Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a free software, Java language library for developing geospatial applications.
SIS enables better representation of coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other relevant spatial needs.
The library is an implementation of [GeoAPI 3.0][geoapi] interfaces and can be used for desktop or server applications.

SIS provides data structures for geographic data and associated metadata along with methods to manipulate those data structures.
The SIS metadata module forms the base of the library and enables the creation of metadata objects which comply
with the ISO 19115 metadata model and which can be read from or written to ISO 19139 compliant XML documents.
The SIS referencing module will enable the construction of geodetic data structures for geospatial referencing
based on the ISO 19111 model such as axis, projection and coordinate reference system definitions, along with the
 associated operations which enable the mathematical conversion of coordinates between different systems of reference.
The SIS storage modules will provide a common approach to the reading and writing of grid coverages applicable to
simple imagery as to many dimensional data structures.
