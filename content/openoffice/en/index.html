    <h1>Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>™ add-in for OpenOffice / LibreOffice</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="../../">Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr></a> is a toolbox offering some Geographic Information System (<abbr>GIS</abbr>) services.
      <abbr title="Spatial Information System">SIS</abbr> is developed as an open source project under Apache 2 license
      and can be used as a foundation for independent projects.
      The <cite>add-in</cite> for <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a> or
      <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> described here is a bridge for accessing
      some Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> functionalities from Calc spreadsheet.
      Currently only coordinate operation services are (partially) made accessible,
      but we hope to open the add-in to more functionalities in the future.
    </p>
