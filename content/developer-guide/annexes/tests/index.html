      <p>
        In addition to its own tests, Apache SIS uses tests defined by GeoAPI.
        One advantages is that those tests provide an external source for the definition of expected results
        (for example the numerical values of coordinates obtained after a map projection).
        Such external source reduce the risk that some tests are actually anti-regression tests
        instead of correctness tests.
        Those tests can also be used by projects other than Apache SIS.
