    <h3 id="CoordinateOperationSteps">Chain of coordinate operation steps</h3>
    <p>
      Coordinate operations may include many steps, each with their own set of parameters.
      For example transformations from one datum (e.g. <abbr>NAD27</abbr>) to another datum (e.g. <abbr>WGS84</abbr>)
      can be approximated by an affine transform (translation, rotation and scale) applied on the <em>geocentric</em> coordinates.
      This implies that the coordinates must be converted from <em>geographic</em> to geocentric domain before the affine transform,
      then back to geographic domain after the affine transform.
      The result is a three-steps process illustrated in the “Conceptual chain of operations” column of the example below.
      However because that operation chain is very common, the <abbr>EPSG</abbr> geodetic dataset provides a shortcut
      named “Geocentric translation <em>in geographic domain</em>”.
      Using this operation, the conversion steps between geographic and geocentric <abbr>CRS</abbr> are implicit.
      Consequently the datum shifts as specified by <abbr>EPSG</abbr> appears as if it was a single operation,
      but the real operation executed by Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> is divided in more steps.
    </p>

    <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
      transformation of geographic coordinates from <abbr>NAD27</abbr> to <abbr>WGS84</abbr> in Canada
      can be approximated by the <abbr>EPSG</abbr>:1172 coordinate operation.
      This single <abbr>EPSG</abbr> operation is actually a chain of three operations in which two steps are implicit.
      The operation as specified by <abbr>EPSG</abbr> is shown in the first column below.
      The same operation with the two hidden steps made explicit is shown in the second column.
      The last column shows the same operation as implemented by Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> under the hood,
      which contains additional operations discussed below.
      For all columns, input coordinates of the first step and output coordinates of the last step
      are (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>) coordinates in degrees.

      <p>
        The operation chain actually performed by Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> is very different than the conceptual operation chain
        because the coordinate systems are not the same.
        Except for the first and last ones, all Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> steps work on right-handed coordinate systems
        (as opposed to the left-handed coordinate system when <var>latitude</var> is before <var>longitude</var>),
        with angular units in radians (instead of degrees) and
        linear units relative to an ellipsoid of semi-major axis length of 1 (instead of Earth’s size).
        Working in those coordinate systems requires additional steps for unit conversions and axes swapping
        at the beginning and at the end of the chain.
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses <cite>affine parametric conversions</cite> for this purpose,
        which allow to combine axes swapping and unit conversions in a single step
        (see <a href="#AffineTransform">affine transform</a> for more information).
        The reason why Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> splits conceptual operations in such fine-grained operations
        is to allow more efficient concatenations of operation steps.
        This approach often allows cancellation of two consecutive affine transforms,
        for example a conversion from radians to degrees (e.g. after a <cite>geocentric to ellipsoid</cite> conversion)
        immediately followed by a conversion from degrees to radians (e.g. before a map projection).
        Another example is the <cite>Affine parametric transformation</cite> step above,
        which combines both the <cite>geocentric translation</cite> step
        and a scale factor implied by the ellipsoid change.
      </p>

    <p>
      All those operation chains can be viewed in <cite>Well Known Text</cite> (<abbr>WKT</abbr>) or pseudo-<abbr>WKT</abbr> format.
      The simplest operation chain, as specified by the authority, is given directly by the
      <code>String</code> representation of the <code>CoordinateOperation</code> instance.
      This <abbr>WKT</abbr> 2 representation contains not only a description of operations with their parameter values,
      but also additional information about the context in which the operation applies (the source and target <abbr>CRS</abbr>)
      together with some metadata like the accuracy and domain of validity.
      Some operation steps and parameters may be omitted if they can be inferred from the context.

            This representation can be obtained by a call to <code>System.out.println(cop)</code>
            where <code>cop</code> is a <code>CoordinateOperation</code> instance.

      An operation chain closer to what Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> really performs is given by the
      <code>String</code> representation of the <code>MathTransform</code> instance.
      In this <abbr>WKT</abbr> 1 representation, contextual information and metadata are lost;
      a <code>MathTransform</code> is like a mathematical function with no knowledge about the meaning of the coordinates on which it operates.
      Since contextual information are lost, implicit operations and parameters become explicit.
      This representation is useful for debugging since any axis swapping operation (for example) become visible.
      Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> constructs this representation from the data structure in memory,
      but convert them in a more convenient form for human, for example by converting radians to degrees.

      If a coordinate operation seems to produce wrong results,
      inspecting the Well Known Text like above should be the first thing to do.
