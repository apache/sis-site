        <h2 id="GridGeometry">Grid coverage domain</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        The domain of a coverage is the set of valid input values.
        In Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>, the domain of grid coverages is described by the <code>GridÂ­Geometry</code> class.
        This class contains the following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A grid extent (a.k.a. <dfn>grid envelope</dfn>), often inferred from the image size in pixels.</li>
        <li>A <dfn>grid to <abbr>CRS</abbr></dfn> conversion, typically as a scale followed by a translation.</li>
        <li>A georeferenced envelope, which can be inferred from the grid extent and the <dfn>grid to <abbr>CRS</abbr></dfn> conversion.</li>
        <li>A Coordinate Reference System (<abbr>CRS</abbr>) which is the target of the <dfn>grid to CRS</dfn> conversion.</li>
        <li>An <em>estimation</em> of grid resolution along each <abbr>CRS</abbr> axes.</li>
        <li>An indication of whether conversion for some axes is linear or not.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One of the most important property listed above is the <dfn>grid to <abbr>CRS</abbr></dfn> conversion,
        which defines how to map pixel coordinates to "real world" coordinates such as latitudes and longitudes.
        This relationship is often linear (an affine transform), but not necessarily;
        <code>GridGeometry</code> accepts non-linear conversions as well.
