        The range of a coverage is the set of valid output values.
        In Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>, the distinction between ranges of numerical values and range of any types of values is represented by
        <code>Number­Range</code> and <code>Range</code> classes respectively.
        The <code>Number­Range</code> is used more often, and is also the one that most closely approaches the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28mathematics%29">the common mathematical concept of an interval</a>.
        This textual representation approaches the specifications of <abbr>ISO</abbr> 31-11 standard,
        except that the comma is replaced by the character “…” as the separator of minimal and maximal values.
        For example, “[0 … 256)” represents the range of values from 0 inclusive to 256 exclusive.
      </p><p>
        <code>Range</code> objects are only indirectly associated with coverages.
        In <abbr>SIS</abbr>, the values that can return coverages are described by objects of the
        <code>Sample­Dimension</code> type.
        It is these that contain instances of <code>Range</code>,
        as well as other information such as <i>transfer function</i> (described later).

      <p>
        The <code class="SIS">SampleDimension.Builder</code> provides convenience methods for building the sample dimensions of a coverage.
        The usage pattern is to invoke the following methods:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>setName(…)</code> for giving a name to a band.</li>
        <li><code>addQuantitative(…)</code> for declaring a range of sample values to convert to units of measurement.</li>
        <li><code>addQualitative(…)</code> for declaring "no data" values.</li>
        <li><code>setBackground(…)</code> for declaring a "no data" value which can also be used for filling empty space.</li>
      </ul>
