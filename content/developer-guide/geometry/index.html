      <p>
        Each geometric object is considered as an infinite set of points
        (except the <code>Point</code> object which contains only itself).
        To better represent this concept, the <code>TransfiniteSet</code> interface
        can be seen as a <code>Set</code> of potentially infinite size in which the elements are points.
        All geometries are specializations of <code>TransfiniteSet</code>.
      </p><p>
        There is two types of structures to represent a point: <code>Point</code> and <code>DirectPosition</code>.
        The first type is a true geometry and may therefore be relatively cumbersome, depending on the implementation.
        The second type is not formally considered to be a geometry;
        it extends neither <code>Geometry</code> nor <code>TransfiniteSet</code>.
        It barely defines any operations besides the storing of a sequence of numbers representing a coordinate.
        It may therefore be a more lightweight object.
      </p><p>
        In order to allow the <abbr>API</abbr> to work equally with these two types of positions,
        <code>Position</code> is defined as a common interface implemented by <code>DirectPosition</code> and <code>Point</code>.
        In practice, the great majority of Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>â€™s <abbr>API</abbr> works on <code>DirectPosition</code>s,
        and occasionally on <code>Position</code>s when it seems useful to also allow geometric points.
