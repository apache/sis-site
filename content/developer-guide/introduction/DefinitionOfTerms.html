      </header>
      <p>
        The meaning of words sometime depend on the community using them.
        The Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> library prefers as much as possible to use terms in the sense of <abbr>OGC</abbr> and <abbr>ISO</abbr> standards.
        Particular care must be taken with the interfaces between <abbr>SIS</abbr> and certain other external libraries.
        For example, the <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19123 standard see <code>CV_Coverage</code> as functions
        in which the <dfn>domain</dfn> is the set of spatio-temporal coordinates encompassed by the data,
        and the <dfn>range</dfn> is the set of values encompassed.
        However, <abbr title="University Corporation for Atmospheric Research">UCAR</abbr>’s <abbr title="Network Common Data Form">netCDF</abbr> library
        applies these terms instead to the function for converting pixel indices (its <dfn>domain</dfn>) to spatial-temporal coordinates (its <dfn>range</dfn>).
        Thus the <abbr>UCAR</abbr> library’s <dfn>range</dfn> may be the <dfn>domain</dfn> of <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19123.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Coverage</dt>
        <dd>Feature that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its spatial,
            temporal or spatiotemporal domain.
            <span class="term-source">ISO 19123</span></dd>

        <dt>Coordinate</dt>
        <dd>One of a sequence of numbers designating the position of a point.
            <span class="term-source">ISO 19111</span></dd>

        <dt>Coordinate operation</dt>
        <dd>Process using a mathematical model, based on a one-to-one relationship, that changes coordinates
            in a source coordinate reference system to coordinates in a target coordinate reference system,
            or that changes coordinates at a source coordinate epoch to coordinates at a target coordinate epoch
            within the same coordinate reference system.
            <span class="term-source">ISO 19111</span></dd>

        <dt>Coordinate reference system</dt>
        <dd>Coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum.
            <span class="term-source">ISO 19111</span></dd>

        <dt>Coordinate system</dt>
        <dd>Set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates are to be assigned to points.
            <span class="term-source">ISO 19111</span></dd>

        <dt>Coordinate tuple</dt>
        <dd>Tuple composed of coordinates.
            The number of coordinates in the coordinate tuple equals the dimension of the coordinate system.
            The order of coordinates in the coordinate tuple is identical to the order of the axes of the coordinate system.
            <span class="term-source">ISO 19111</span></dd>

        <dt>Datum</dt>
        <dd>Parameter or set of parameters that realize the position of the origin,
            the scale, and the orientation of a coordinate system.
            <span class="term-source">ISO 19111</span></dd>

        <dt>Domain</dt>
        <dd>Well-defined set.
            <span class="term-source">ISO 19123</span></dd>

        <dt>Range</dt>
        <dd>Set of feature attribute values associated by a function with the elements of the domain of a coverage.
            <span class="term-source">ISO 19123</span></dd>
