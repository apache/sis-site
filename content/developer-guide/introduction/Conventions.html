        The elements defined in a computer language, such as classes and methods in Java or elements in an <abbr>XML</abbr> document,
        appear in monospaced font in this document.
        In order to facilitate an understanding of the relationships between Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> and the standards,
        these elements are also represented using the following color codes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Elements in blue are defined in an <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>
          or <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> standard other than GeoAPI.
        </li>
        <li>
          Elements in green are Java element defined in GeoAPI.
        </li>
        <li>
          Elements in brown are defined in Apache <abbr title="Spatial Information System">SIS</abbr>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Elements left in black are either defined elsewhere (for example the standard Java library),
          or there is no emphasis on that element for the discussion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example to represent a projected coordinate reference system (Mercator, Lambert, <i>etc</i>),
        <code class="OGC">SC_ProjectedCRS</code> is an <abbr>UML</abbr> and <abbr>XML</abbr> element defined by the <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19111 standard.
        Then <code class="API">org.​opengis.​referencing.​crs.​<b>ProjectedCRS</b></code> is the implementation-neutral GeoAPI interface derived from that standard,
        and <code class="SIS">org.​apache.​sis.​referencing.​crs.​<b>DefaultProjectedCRS</b></code> is the implementation class provided by Apache SIS.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apache SIS implements most GeoAPI interfaces by a classes of the same name than the interface
        but prefixed by <code>Abstract</code>, <code>Default</code> or <code>General</code> word.
        The <code>General</code> prefix is sometimes used instead of <code>Default</code>
        to indicate that alternative implementations are available for some specific cases.
        For example the <code class="API">Envelope</code> interface is implemented by at least two Apache SIS classes:
        <code class="SIS">GeneralEnvelope</code> and <code class="SIS">Envelope2D</code>.
        The first implementation can represent envelopes with any number of dimensions
        while the second implementation is specialized for two-dimensional envelopes.
      </p><p>
        Apache SIS classes prefixed by <code>Abstract</code> should not (in principle) be instantiated.
        Users should instantiate a non-abstract subclass instead.
        However many <abbr>SIS</abbr> classes are only conceptually abstract,
        without <code>abstract</code> Java keyword in class definition.
        Such classes can be instantiated by a <code>new AbstractXXX(…)</code> statement despite being conceptually abstract.
        Such instantiations should be avoided, but are nevertheless permitted in last resort when it is not possible to determine the exact subtype.
