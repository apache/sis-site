Apache SIS is a spatial framework that enables better representation of coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other relevant spatial needs. SIS provides data structures for geographic data and associated metadata along with methods to manipulate those data structures. The SIS metadata module forms the base of the library and enables the creation of metadata objects which comply with the ISO 19115 metadata model and which can be read from or written to ISO 19139 compliant XML documents.
