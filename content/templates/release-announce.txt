Apache SIS is a spatial framework that enables better representation of coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs. SIS provides data structures for geographic data and associated metadata along with methods to manipulate those data structures. The library is an implementation of GeoAPI 3.0 interfaces and can be used for desktop or server applications. Some SIS features are:

    Geographic metadata (ISO 19115-1:2014)
        Read/write ISO 19139 compliant XML documents.
    Referencing by coordinates (ISO 19111:2007)
        Well Known Text (WKT) version 1 and 2 (ISO 19162:2015).
        Geographic Markup Language (GML) version 3.2 (ISO 19136:2007).
