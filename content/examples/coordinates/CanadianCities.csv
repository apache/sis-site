# Coordinates of some cities in Canada. The coordinates are given
# with only 3 significant digits, which implies an uncertainty of
# more than 100 metres. With such uncertainty, it does not matter
# if the geodetic datum is WGS84, NAD83 or NAD27 since the error
# is greater than the difference between those datums.
#
# Axis order is latitude first, then longitude. Units are degrees.
