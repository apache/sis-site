The initial plan for Apache SIS 0.5 was to complete the implementation of Referencing by coordinates (ISO 19111),
which started in SIS 0.4. However this work is not yet finished and is re-targeted for SIS 0.6 release.
Nevertheless this SIS 0.5 release contains an upgrade of spatial metadata (ISO 19115-1)
from the standard published in 2003 to the revision published in 2014 (SIS-94).
We think that this metadata upgrade, together with the new `Feature` implementations (SIS-190), are worth a release.
