title: SIS 1.4 Release notes
---

* Release date: **2023-01-10**
* Next release
* [Previous release](1.3.html)
* [Incompatible changes](#compatibility)
* [Noticeable changes](#issues)
* Requirement: Java 11

This release contains the upgrade from Java 8 to Java 11,
including the migration to Java Platform Module System (JPMS).
This release also contains various bug fixes improving the stability.
Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) support has been completed with the
automatic use of HTTP Range requests.

In this release, the source code of Apache SIS project has been restructured with a new directory layout.
The new layout uses
[Module Source Hierarchy](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/man/javac.html#directory-hierarchies)
and is described [in annex of this release notes](Modularization.html).
This change can be ignored when only the pre-compiled JAR files are used.

# Incompatible changes    {#compatibility}

The following changes in Apache SIS 1.4 are incompatibles with the previous release (SIS 1.3):

* In the `org.apache.sis.storage.aggregate` package, two classes got an incompatible change: `JoinFeatureSet` and `ConcatenatedFeatureSet`.
  In those two classes, the `StoreListeners` argument given to the constructor is replaced by a `Resource` argument.
* The constant value defined by `PlanarImage.SAMPLE_RESOLUTIONS_KEY` has been modified from singular to plural
  (i.e., a "s"  has been added to the `String` value). It was done for consistency with `SAMPLE_DIMENSIONS_KEY`.
  Projects do not need to modify their code, only to recompile.
* In the method signatures of the `Filter` and `Expression` interfaces,
  parameterized type `<? super R>` become `<R>`.
* `org.apache.sis.util.ResourceInternationalString` become an abstract class.
  Furthermore the constructor method signature changed.
  Those changes were needed for JPMS.
