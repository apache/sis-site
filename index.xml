      <description>Apache SIS is built by Maven. For installing the JAR files in the local Maven repository, execute the following command from the SIS project root:
mvn install The JavaFX application is excluded by default because it depends on the JavaFX platform which is distributed under GPL license (note that the SIS module stay under Apache 2 licence). Likewise the EPSG geodetic dataset is excluded by default for licensing reasons. For including the JavaFX module and the use of EPSG dataset in the build:</description>

      <description>Apache SIS source code is maintained using Git version control, completed by optional data maintained using Subversion version control. Optional data include in particular the EPSG geodetic dataset, which is subject to licensing terms different than Apache ones. This page describes two ways to checkout Apache SIS source code:
 A basic checkout with only the main repository, the most stable branch, and no configuration requirement. A more advanced configuration for active SIS developments, using uncommitted (for now) API and including optional data for more extensive tests.</description>

      <description>A command-line interface is provided for extracting information from data files or authority codes, and for performing coordinate operations. That command-line tool is provided for allowing users to experiment some Apache SIS functionalities without writing Java code. For each example, key Java APIs are listed for allowing users to reproduce the functionality in their own application.

      <description>Apache SIS can read data from the formats listed below. Some formats are supported in read-only mode, others in read/write modes. Data may be structured as vectors or rasters, which in Apache SIS are mapped to the FeatureSet and GridCoverageResource interfaces respectively. Some formats can contain an arbitrary number of feature types or rasters, in which case the root resource will be Aggregate.

      <title>How to use EPSG geodetic dataset</title>
      <link>https://sis.apache.org/epsg.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://sis.apache.org/epsg.html</guid>
      <description>The EPSG geodetic dataset is a de-facto standard providing thousands of Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definitions together with information about how to perform coordinate operations, their accuracies and their domains of validity. The EPSG dataset is owned and maintained by the International Association of Oil &amp;amp; Gas producers. Usage of EPSG dataset with Apache SIS is optional but strongly recommended: without that geodetic dataset, only a small subset of CRS definitions will be available (basically the constants enumerated in the CommonCRS Java class) unless full definitions are provided in Well Known Text (WKT) or Geographic Markup Language (GML) formats.</description>

      <guid>https://sis.apache.org/javafx.html</guid>
      <description>Apache SIS provides an optional JavaFX application for testing SIS capability to read, transform and visualize data files. (note: a command line interface is also available). The graphical application is in early development stage and very far from providing all services that we can expect from a Geographic Information System (GIS). Furthermore this application covers a very small subset of Apache SIS capabilities. But it can give an idea of what is available there.</description>

      <description>Improving and extending Apache SIS requires extensive knowledge of geographic information science, object oriented programming, the Java language, and of the library itself. Contributors should expect that they will need to learn a great deal before being able to become productive. However, the effort required to become productive should improve the contributor&amp;rsquo;s understanding and knowledge of geographic information systems, of geodetic and geographic science, and of effective computer programming.
This document is expected to evolve as the Apache SIS project develops its own mode of operation.</description>

      <description>Apache SIS implements the following standards from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) or the Java Community Process (JCP). The same standard is sometimes published jointly by both OGC and ISO organizations. Links to free versions of the standards are given when available. The Upgrade needed column indicates that a more recent version of the standard is available but that Apache SIS has not yet been upgraded to that version.</description>
