      <p>
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses different libraries to read and write different types of objects.
        The library used depends on the complexity of the object and on performance constraints.
        For example, <abbr title="Java Architecture for XML Binding">JAXB</abbr> annotations have the advantage of being close to code,
        which makes it easier to maintain mapping between Java and <abbr>XML</abbr>.
        On the other hand, <abbr title="Simple API for XML">SAX</abbr> is more efficient.
        In general, Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses:
      </p>
      <ul class="verbose">
        <li>
          <abbr>JAXB</abbr> for objects that do not occur very often in <abbr>XML</abbr> documents, but with complex structures and deep hierarchies.
          The metadata set in <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19115-3 standard is a typical example
        </li>
        <li>
          <abbr>SAX</abbr> for objects that are relatively simple, but which may exist in very large numbers.
          The set of points in a geometry is a typical example.
        </li>
        <li>
          <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> as an alternative to <abbr>JAXB</abbr>
          when the <abbr>XML</abbr> elements do not correspond exactly to Java attributes.
          <i>Features</i> are an example, as their structure is dynamic.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="XML-SIS">Implementation strategy in Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr></h4>
      <p>
        <code>org.apache.sis.internal.jaxb.*</code> packages (non-public) define <abbr>JAXB</abbr> adaptors for all types of <abbr>ISO</abbr> objects.
        These adaptors are required anyway to allow <abbr>JAXB</abbr> to get <abbr>SIS</abbr> classes while implementing GeoAPI interfaces.
        Conveniently, <abbr>SIS</abbr> made both <abbr>JAXB</abbr> adaptors and objects wrapping the “real” object to be read or written.
        This double usage avoids having to double the number of classes (already quite high) present in the internal packages.
      </p>
      <h4>Naming conventions in <abbr>XSD</abbr> schemas</h4>
      <p>
        For each element of the first group listed above, the <abbr>XSD</abbr> schemas of the <abbr>OGC</abbr>
        define a type whose name ends with “<code class="OGC">_PropertyType</code>”.
        For the second group, each element has a type whose name ends with “<code class="OGC">_Type</code>”.
        The “<code class="OGC">_PropertyType</code>” elements may have a group of attributes
        (such as <code>gco:uuidref</code> and <code>xlink:href</code>)
        which the <abbr>XSD</abbr> schemas collectively name <code>gco:ObjectIdentification</code>.
        These attributes do not have dedicated Java methods, but are accessible indirectly via the
        <code class="SIS">IdentifiedObject</code> interface described in the following subsection.
