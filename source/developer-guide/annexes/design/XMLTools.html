      <p>
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses different libraries to read and write different types of objects.
        The library used depends on the complexity of the object and on performance constraints.
        For example, <abbr title="Java Architecture for XML Binding">JAXB</abbr> annotations have the advantage of being close to code,
        which makes it easier to maintain mapping between Java and <abbr>XML</abbr>.
        On the other hand, <abbr title="Simple API for XML">SAX</abbr> is more efficient.
        In general, Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses:
      </p>
      <ul class="verbose">
        <li>
          <abbr>JAXB</abbr> for objects that do not occur very often in <abbr>XML</abbr> documents, but with complex structures and deep hierarchies.
          The metadata set in <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19115-3 standard is a typical example
        </li>
        <li>
          <abbr>SAX</abbr> for objects that are relatively simple, but which may exist in very large numbers.
          The set of points in a geometry is a typical example.
        </li>
        <li>
          <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> as an alternative to <abbr>JAXB</abbr>
          when the <abbr>XML</abbr> elements do not correspond exactly to Java attributes.
          <i>Features</i> are an example, as their structure is dynamic.
        </li>
      </ul>
