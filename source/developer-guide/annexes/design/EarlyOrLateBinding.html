      </header>
      <p>
        Because of the <abbr>WGS84</abbr> ubiquity, it is tempting to use that system as a hub or a pivot system
        for all coordinate transformations.
        The use of an “universal” system as a pivot simplifies the design of coordinate transformations libraries.
        For example transformations from datum <var>A</var> to datum <var>B</var> can be done by first transforming
        from <var>A</var> to <abbr>WGS84</abbr>, then from <abbr>WGS84</abbr> to <var>B</var>.
        With such approach, a coordinate transformations library would only need to associate each
        <code>GeodeticDatum</code> instance with the transformation parameters from that datum to <abbr>WGS84</abbr>.
        This approach was encouraged in version 1 of <abbr>WKT</abbr> format, since that format specified a
        <code>TOWGS84[…]</code> element (removed in <abbr>WKT</abbr> version 2) precisely for that purpose.
        This approach is known in <abbr>EPSG</abbr> guidance notes as “early binding” implementations
        since information about coordinate transformations are associated early in geodetic object definitions,
        usually right at <code>GeographicCRS</code> creation time.
        While <abbr>EPSG</abbr> acknowledges that this approach is commonly used,
        this is not a recommended strategy for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul class="verbose">
        <li>More than one transformation may exist from datum <var>A</var> to datum <var>B</var>,
            where each transformation is designed for a different geographic area.</li>
        <li>Some operations are designed specifically for transformations from <var>A</var> to <var>B</var>
            and do not have the same accuracy than an operation using <abbr>WGS84</abbr> as an intermediate step.</li>
        <li><abbr>WGS84</abbr> itself has been updated many times,
            which makes it a kind of moving target (admittedly slowly) for coordinate transformations libraries.</li>
        <li>Different systems could be used as the pivot system, for example the <cite>Galileo Reference Frame</cite>
            (<abbr>GTRF</abbr>) created for the European <abbr>GPS</abbr> competitor.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
        the <abbr>EPSG</abbr> geodetic dataset defines about 50 transformations from <abbr>NAD27</abbr> to <abbr>NAD83</abbr>.
        In an early binding approach, the same geographic <abbr>CRS</abbr> (namely “<abbr>NAD27</abbr>”) in the <abbr>WKT</abbr> 1
        format would need to be defined with a <code>TOWGS84[-8, 160, 176]</code> element for coordinates in <abbr>USA</abbr>
        or with a <code>TOWGS84[-10, 158, 187]</code> element for coordinates in Canada.
        Different parameter values exist for other regions like Cuba, so it is not possible to represent such diversity
        with a single <code>TOWGS84[…]</code> element associated to a <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
        But even when restricting <abbr>CRS</abbr> usage to the domain of validity of its single <code>TOWGS84[…]</code> element,
        those transformations are still approximative with a 10 metres accuracy in the <abbr>USA</abbr> case.
        More accurate transformations exist in the form of <abbr>NADCON</abbr> grid shift files,
        but those transformations are from <abbr>NAD27</abbr> to <abbr>NAD83</abbr> (which move together on the same continental plate),
        not to <abbr>WGS84</abbr> (which move independently).
        The difference was often ignored when <abbr>NAD83</abbr> and <abbr>WGS84</abbr> were considered as practically equivalent,
        but that assumption is subject to more caution today.
      </p></div>
      <p>
        <abbr>EPSG</abbr> rather recommends the use of “late binding” approach,
        in which coordinate transformation methods and parameters are defined for
        “<var>A</var> to <var>B</var>” pairs of systems (eventually completed with domain of validity)
        rather than associated to standalone datums.
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> is a “late binding” implementation,
        while some reminiscences of “early binding” approach still exist in the form of the
        <code>DefaultGeodeticDatum.getBursaWolfParameters()</code> property.
        The later is used only if <abbr>SIS</abbr> fails to apply the late binding approach for given reference systems.
