      <p>
        Affine transforms, introduced <a href="#AffineTransform">earlier</a>, are extensively used by Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>.
        About all graphical libraries support some kind of coordinate operations, usually as <dfn>affine transforms</dfn>
        or a slight generalization like <dfn>perspective transforms</dfn>.
        Each library defines its own <abbr>API</abbr>. Some examples are listed below:
      </p>
      <table>
        <caption>Affine transform implementations in graphical libraries</caption>
        <tr><th>Library</th>                                  <th>Transform implementation</th>                          <th>Dimensions</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Java2D</td>                                   <td><code>java.awt.geom.AffineTransform</code></td>        <td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Java3D</td>                                   <td><code>javax.media.j3d.Transform3D</code></td>          <td>3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>JavaFX</td>                                   <td><code>javafx.scene.transform.Affine</code></td>        <td>2 or 3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Java Advanced Imaging (<abbr>JAI</abbr>)</td> <td><code>javax.media.jai.PerspectiveTransform</code></td> <td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Android</td>                                  <td><code>android.graphics.Matrix</code></td>              <td>2</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        However in many cases, affine or perspective transforms are the only kind of coordinate operations supported by the graphical library.
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> needs to handle a wider range of operations, in which affine transforms are only special cases.
        In particular most map projections and datum shifts can not be represented by affine transforms.
        <abbr>SIS</abbr> also needs to support arbitrary number of dimensions,
        while above-cited <abbr>API</abbr> restrict the use to a fixed number of dimensions.
        For those reasons <abbr>SIS</abbr> can not use directly the above-cited <abbr>API</abbr>.
        Instead, <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses the more abstract <code>org.opengis.referencing.transform.MathTransform</code> interface.
        But in the special case where the transform is actually affine, <abbr>SIS</abbr> may try to use an existing implementation,
        in particular Java2D. The following Java code can be used in situations where the Java2D object is desired:
      </p>

<pre><code>MathTransform mt = ...;    // Any math transform created by Apache SIS.
if (mt instanceof AffineTransform) {
    AffineTransform at = (AffineTransform) mt;
    // Use Java2D API from here.
}</code></pre>

      <p>
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses Java2D on a <em>best effort</em> basis only.
        The above cast is not guaranteed to succeed,
        even when the <code>MathTransform</code> meets the requirements allowing Java2D usage.
