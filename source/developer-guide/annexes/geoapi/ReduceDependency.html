        <h3 id="ReduceDependency">Reduce direct dependency to Apache SIS</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        Previous chapters used Apache SIS static methods for convenience.
        In some cases, usage of those convenience methods can be replaced by Java code using only GeoAPI methods.
        Such replacements may be desirable for applications who want to reduce direct dependency toward Apache SIS,
        for example in order to ease migrations between SIS and other GeoAPI implementations.
        However this may require that applications write their own convenience methods.
        The following sections provide some tip for easing this task.
      </p>

      <h4 id="UML-annotation-indep">Mapping given by <code>@UML</code> annotations</h4>
      <p>
        For each class, method and constant defined by an <abbr>OGC</abbr> or <abbr>ISO</abbr> standard,
        GeoAPI indicates its provenance using annotations defined in the <code>org.opengis.annotation</code> package.
        This mapping is described in the <a href="#UML-annotation">chapter about GeoAPI</a>.
        Java reflection methods allow access to this information during the execution of an application.
        Class <code>org.apache.sis.util.iso.Types</code> provides static convenience methods like
        <code class="SIS">getStandardName(Class)</code>, but one can avoid those methods.
        The following example displays the standard name for the method <code class="GeoAPI">getTitle()</code> from the <code>Citation</code> interface:
      </p>

<pre><code>Class&lt;?&gt; type   = Citation.class;
Method   method = type.getMethod("<code class="GeoAPI">getTitle</code>", (Class&lt;?&gt;[]) null);
UML      annot  = method.getAnnotation(UML.class);
String   id     = annot.identifier();
System.out.println("The standard name for the " + method.getName() + " method is " + id);</code></pre>

      <p>
        The reverse operation — getting the Java class and method from a standard name — is a bit more complicated.
        It requires reading the <code class="GeoAPI">class-index.properties</code> file provided in the <code>org.opengis.annotation</code> package.
        The following example reads the files just before searching for the name of the interface corresponding to <code>CI_Citation</code>.
        Users are always encouraged to only read this file once and then save its contents in their application’s cache.
      </p>

<pre><code>Properties isoToGeoAPI = new Properties();
try (InputStream in = UML.class.getResourceAsStream("<code class="GeoAPI">class-index.properties</code>")) {
    isoToGeoAPI.load(in);
}
String isoName = "<code class="OGC">CI_Citation</code>";
String geoName = getProperty(isoName);
Class&lt;?&gt;  type = Class.forName(geoName);
System.out.println("The GeoAPI interface for <abbr>ISO</abbr> type " + isoName + " is " + type);</code></pre>

      <p>
        The <code>org.apache.sis.util.iso.Types</code> convenience method for above task is
        <code class="SIS">forStandardName(String)</code>.
      </p>



      <h4 id="ServiceLoader">Fetching implementations of GeoAPI interfaces</h4>
      <p>
        GeoAPI defines factories (<code>Factory</code>) that can create implementations of interfaces.
        For example, <code>DatumFactory</code> provides methods that can create instances which implement interfaces of the
        <code>org.opengis.referencing.datum</code> package.
        A <code>Factory</code> must be implemented by a geospatial library,
        and declared as a <i>service</i> as defined by the <code>java.util.ServiceLoader</code> class.
        The <code>ServiceLoader</code> javadoc explains this procedure.
        In brief, the library must create a file in the <code>META-INF/services/</code> directory,
        with a name corresponding to the complete name of an interface in the factory
        (in the preceding example, <code>org.opengis.referencing.datum.DatumFactory</code>).
        On one line, this text file must include the complete name of the class that implements this interface.
        This class may be hidden from users, as they do not need to know of its existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the library has correctly declared its factories as services,
        users may import them by using <code>ServiceLoader</code>, as in the example below.
        This example only takes the first factory located; if there is more than one factory -
        for example when multiple libraries coexist — then the choice is left to the user.
      </p>

<pre><code>import org.opengis.referencing.GeodeticDatum;
import org.opengis.referencing.DatumFactory;
import java.util.ServiceLoader;

public class MyApplication {
    public void createMyDatum() {
        ServiceLoader  loader = ServiceLoader.load(DatumFactory.class);
        DatumFactory  factory = loader.iterator().next();
        GeodeticDatum myDatum = factory.createGeodeticDatum(…);
    }
}</code></pre>



      <h5 id="GeoAPI-simple">Defining custom implementations</h5>
      <p>
        Implementing GeoAPI oneself in order to meet very specific needs is not difficult.
        A developer might concentrate on a handful of interfaces among the hundreds available,
        while keeping other interfaces as extension points to eventually implement as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conceptual model that the interfaces represent is complex. But this complexity may be reduced by combining certain interfaces.
        For example, many libraries, even well-known ones, do not distinguish between a <dfn>Coordinate System</dfn> (<abbr>CS</abbr>)
        and a <dfn>Coordinate <u>Reference</u> System</dfn> (<abbr>CRS</abbr>).
        A developer that also wishes not to make this distinction may implement these two interfaces with the same class.
        The resulting implementation may have a simpler class hierarchy than that of GeoAPI interfaces.
        The <code>geoapi-examples</code> module, discussed later, provides such combinations.
        The following table lists a few possible combinations:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Main Interface</th>
          <th>Auxiliary Interface</th>
          <th>Use</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>CoordinateReferenceSystem</code></td>
          <td><code>CoordinateSystem</code></td>
          <td>Description of a spatial reference system (<abbr>CRS</abbr>).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>GeodeticDatum</code></td>
          <td><code>Ellipsoid</code></td>
          <td>Description of the geodetic datum.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>CoordinateOperation</code></td>
          <td><code>MathTransform</code></td>
          <td>Coordinate transformation operations.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>IdentifiedObject</code></td>
          <td><code>ReferenceIdentifier</code></td>
          <td>An objet (usually a <abbr>CRS</abbr>) that we can identify by a code.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Citation</code></td>
          <td><code>InternationalString</code></td>
          <td>Bibliographic reference consisting of a simple title.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>GeographicBoundingBox</code></td>
          <td><code>Extent</code></td>
          <td>Spatial area in degrees of longitude and latitude.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>ParameterValue</code></td>
          <td><code>ParameterDescriptor</code></td>
          <td>Description of a parameter (name, type) associated with its value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>ParameterValueGroup</code></td>
          <td><code>ParameterDescriptorGroup</code></td>
          <td>Description of a set of parameters associated with their values.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p id="GeoAPI-examples">
        The <code>geoapi-examples</code> module provides examples of simple implementations.
        Many of these classes implement more than one interface at a time in order to provide a simpler conceptual model.
        The <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/geoapi-examples/apidocs/overview-summary.html">javadoc for this module</a>
        lists key packages and classes along with the combinations performed.
        This module illustrates not only how GeoAPI might be implemented,
        but also how the implementation might be tested using <code>geoapi-conformance</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although its primary goal is to serve as a source of inspiration for implementors,
        <code>geoapi-examples</code> was also designed so as to be usable by applications with very simple needs.
        As all the examples are in the public domain, developers are invited to freely adapt copies of these classes as necessary.
        However, if changes are made outside the framework of the GeoAPI project,
        fair use demands that modified copies be placed in a package with a different name than <code>org.opengis</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For somewhat more involved needs, developers are invited to examine the
        <code>geoapi-proj4</code> and <code>geoapi-netcdf</code> modules.
        These two modules provide examples of adaptors that are allowed, via GeoAPI interfaces,
        to use some of the features of external libraries (Proj.4 and <abbr>netCDF</abbr>).
        The advantage of using these interfaces is to provide a unified model to operate two very different <abbr>API</abbr>s,
        while retaining the ability to switch easily to another library if desired.
