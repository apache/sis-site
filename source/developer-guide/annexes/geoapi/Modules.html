      <p>
        The GeoAPI project consists of a standardized part (<code>geoapi</code>)
        and an experimental part (<code>geoapi-pending</code>).
        As these two parts are mutually exclusive, users must take care not to mix them in the same project.
        This separation is guaranteed for all projects that depend only on the Maven central repository
        (including the final versions of Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>),
        as the <code>geoapi-pending</code> module is never deployed on this central repository.
        By contrast, certain <abbr>SIS</abbr> development branches may depend on <code>geoapi-pending</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        GeoAPI modules are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          <b><code>geoapi</code></b> — includes interfaces covered by the
          <a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/geoapi">GeoAPI standard of the <abbr>OGC</abbr></a>.
          The final versions of Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> depend on this module.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <b><code>geoapi-pending</code></b> — contains a
          <em>copy</em> of all interfaces in the <code>geoapi</code> module
          (not a dependence) with additions that have not yet been approved as an <abbr>OGC</abbr> standard.
          Some additions appear in interfaces normally defined by the <code>geoapi</code> module, hence the need to copy them.
          Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>’s development branches depend on this module,
          but this dependence becomes a dependence on the <code>geoapi</code> standard module
          when the development branches are merged to the main branch.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <b><code>geoapi-conformance</code></b> — includes a JUnit test suite that developers may use to test their implementations.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <b><code>geoapi-examples</code></b> — includes examples of relatively simple implementations.
          These examples are placed in the public domain in order to encourage users to copy and adapt them to their needs if
          Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> services are unsuitable.
        </p></li>
      </ul>
