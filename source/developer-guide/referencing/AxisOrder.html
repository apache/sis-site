        <h2 id="AxisOrder">Axis order</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        The axis order is specified by the authority (typically a national agency) defining the <dfn>Coordinate Reference System</dfn> (<abbr>CRS</abbr>).
        The order depends on the <abbr>CRS</abbr> type and the country defining the <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
        In the case of geographic <abbr>CRS</abbr>, the (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>) axis order is widely used by geographers and pilots for centuries.
        However software developers tend to consistently use the (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) order for every kind of <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
        Those different practices resulted in contradictory definitions of axis order for almost every <abbr>CRS</abbr> of kind <code>GeographicCRS</code>,
        for some <code>ProjectedCRS</code> in the South hemisphere (South Africa, Australia, <i>etc.</i>) and for some polar projections among others.
      </p><p>
        Recent <abbr>OGC</abbr> standards mandate the use of axis order as defined by the authority.
        Oldest <abbr>OGC</abbr> standards used the (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) axis order instead, ignoring any authority specification.
        Many software products still use the old (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) axis order,
        maybe because such uniformization makes <abbr>CRS</abbr> implementation and usage <em>apparently</em> easier.
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> supports both conventions with the following approach:
        by default, <abbr>SIS</abbr> creates <abbr>CRS</abbr> with axis order <em>as defined by the authority</em>.
        Those <abbr>CRS</abbr> are created by calls to the <code>CRS.forCode(String)</code> method
        and the actual axis order can be verified after the <abbr>CRS</abbr> creation with <code>System.out.println(crs)</code>.
        But if (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) axis order is wanted for compatibility with older <abbr>OGC</abbr> specifications or other software products,
        then <abbr>CRS</abbr> forced to <em>longitude first</em> axis order can be created by a call to the following method:
      </p>

<pre><code>CoordinateReferenceSystem crs = …;               // CRS obtained by any means.
crs = AbstractCRS.castOrCopy(crs).forConvention(AxesConvention.RIGHT_HANDED)</code></pre>

      <p>
        Among the legacy <abbr>OGC</abbr> standards that used the non-conform axis order,
        an influent one is version 1 of the <cite>Well Known Text</cite> (<abbr>WKT</abbr>) format specification.
        According that widely-used format, <abbr>WKT</abbr> 1 definitions without explicit <code>AXIS[…]</code> elements
        shall default to (<var>longitude</var>, <var>latitude</var>) or (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) axis order.
        In version 2 of <abbr>WKT</abbr> format, <code>AXIS[…]</code> elements are no longer optional
        and should contain an explicit <code>ORDER[…]</code> sub-element for making the intended order yet more obvious.
        But if <code>AXIS[…]</code> elements are nevertheless missing in a <abbr>WKT</abbr> 2 definition,
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> defaults to (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>) order.
        So in summary:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Default <abbr>WKT</abbr> 1 axis order of geographic <abbr>CRS</abbr> is (<var>longitude</var>, <var>latitude</var>) as mandated by <abbr>OGC</abbr> 01-009 specification.</li>
        <li>Default <abbr>WKT</abbr> 2 axis order of geographic <abbr>CRS</abbr> is (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>),
            but this is <abbr>SIS</abbr>-specific as <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19162 does not mention default axis order.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To avoid ambiguities, users are encouraged to always provide explicit <code>AXIS[…]</code> elements in their <abbr>WKT</abbr>.
