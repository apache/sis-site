        Apache <abbr title="Spatial Information System">SIS</abbr> is a free software,
        Java language library for developing geospatial desktop or server applications.
        This library provides services for data discovery (metadata), reading and writing vector or raster data,
        filtering the data and applying operations such as map projections.
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> data structures follow closely the geospatial models defined in the international standards published by
        the Open Geospatial Consortium (<abbr>OGC</abbr>) and the International Organization for Standardization (<abbr>ISO</abbr>).
        The <a href="#Annexes">annex</a> provides more context about international standards.
      </p><p>
        The library is an implementation of <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> <a href="http://www.geoapi.org">GeoAPI</a> interfaces.
        In a series of <code>org.opengis.*</code> packages, GeoAPI offers a set of implementation-neutral Java interfaces for geospatial applications.
        These interfaces closely follow the specifications of the <abbr>OGC</abbr>, while interpreting and adapting them
        to meet the needs of Java developers â€” for example, conforming with Java naming conventions.
        The conceptual model of GeoAPI will be explained in detail in the chapters describing Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> implementation.
        However, we can get an overview of its content by consulting the page listing the mapping between
        <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/3.0/javadoc/content.html">GeoAPI methods and the standards where they come from</a>.
        The <a href="#GeoAPI">annex</a> provides more details about GeoAPI history and how to use it.
      </p><p>
        While Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> is primarily a library for helping developers to create their own applications,
        <abbr>SIS</abbr> provides also an optional JavaFX application for testing its capability to read, transform and visualize data files.
        Screenshots of this application may be used in this document for illustrative purposes.
