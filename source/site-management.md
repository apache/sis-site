This page explains how the Apache SIS web site is created and how to update the site.
The intended audiences are SIS release managers and SIS web site maintainers.

# Directory layout    {#directory-layout}

The source files for the Apache SIS web site can be fetched from Subversion using the following command:

{{< highlight bash >}}
git clone https://github.com/apache/sis-site
{{< / highlight >}}

The directory layout is as below, omitting version numbers in file names.
The `*` character stands for an arbitrary amount of files having the given extension.

{{< highlight text >}}
sis-site
├─ source
│  └─ *.mdtext
├─ static
│   ├─ css
│   │  ├─ bootstrap.min.css
│   │  └─ sis.css
│   ├─ img
│   │  └─ *.png
│   ├─ js
│   │  ├─ bootstrap.js
│   │  └─ jquery.js
└─ templates
   ├─ single_narrative.html
   └─ skeleton.html
{{< / highlight >}}

All files with the `.mdtext` extension use the Markdown format, which is described there:

* [General markup syntax][markdown]
* [Extension to the syntax][extension]

New `.mdtext` files can be created using the [site-management.mdtext][template] file as a template.
Thee files can be modified in any text editor and committed with the usual Git commands.
The site must be built manually by executing the `hugo` comment from the project root directory.
The web site will be written in the `target/content/` sub-directory.
Copying those files in the `asf-staging` branch will make them visible in the _staging_ area at
[https://sis.staged.apache.org/](https://sis.staged.apache.org/).
Once a staging site has been approved, it can be published by merging the `asf-staging` branch
to the `asf-site` branch.

# Content    {#content}

All `.mdtext` files should start as below (replace the `<...>` block by the corresponding content):

{{< highlight markdown >}}
Title:  <put the page title here>
Notice: <copy the notice from an existing page>
{{< / highlight >}}

The title will appear both in the browser window title bar, and as a header at the beginning of the generated HTML page.
The notice should be followed by a short abstract of the page content (typically a single paragraph),
then a _Table Of Content_ to be automatically generated:

{{< highlight markdown >}}
[TOC]
{{< / highlight >}}

The first header appears after the table of content.
For each header, and anchor should be specified using the `{#...}` syntax.
Do not rely on automatically generated anchors, since they may not be stable if some text in the header is modified.
Example:

{{< highlight markdown >}}
My first header in my page    {#firstHeader}
============================================
{{< / highlight >}}

# Style sheets

The following table lists the style sheets used by Apache SIS.
The Maven and Javadoc style sheets are mentioned for completeness, but are not located on the web site repository.
They are rather located together with the SIS library source code.

Page set   | File                                 | Purpose            | Remark
---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------
Web site   | `content/css/bootstrap.min.css`      | Main appearance    | Generated from the [Twitter's Bootstrap project][bootstrap].
Web site   | `http://www.apache.org/css/code.css` | Code highlighting  | Located on the foundation-wide Apache server.
Web site   | `content/css/sis.css`                | SIS-specific style | Overwrite `bootstrap.min.css`, edited manually.
Maven site | `src/site/resources/css/site.css`    | Maven site         | Overwrite `maven-base.css`, edited manually.
Javadoc    | `src/main/javadoc/stylesheet.css`    | Javadoc appearance | Copy of javadoc output, edited manually.

## Updating bootstrap    {#bootstrap}

If the `bootstrap.min.css` file needs to be updated, then visit the [Bootstrap][bootstrap] web site
and select the following options:

* Scaffolding
  + Body type and links
  + Grid system
  + Layouts
* Components
  + Navs, tabs, and pills
  + Navbar
* Miscellaneous
  + Wells
* Base CSS
  + Code and pre
* JS Components
  + Dropdowns

If additional options are needed, then select the **minimal** amount of new options.
Do not select an option that _may_ be used; select only the options that are actually going to be used.
Then:

* Update this page for listing the new options.
* Download the `bootstrap.zip` file and unzip in the `content` directory, overwriting the existing files.
* Delete `css/bootstrap.css`, since it is not used.
* Add the following comment in `css/bootstrap.min.css`, just below the copyright header:

`bootstrap.min.css`:

{{< highlight css >}}
