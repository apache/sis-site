        <h2 id="Tests">Test suites</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        In addition to its own tests, Apache SIS uses tests defined by GeoAPI.
        One advantages is that those tests provide an external source for the definition of expected results
        (for example the numerical values of coordinates obtained after a map projection).
        Such external source reduce the risk that some tests are actually anti-regression tests
        instead of correctness tests.
        Those tests can also be used by projects other than Apache SIS.
      </p>
      <p id="GeoAPI-conformance">
        The <code>geoapi-conformance</code> module provides <i>validators</i>, a JUnit <i>test suite</i>, and <i>report generators</i>
        in the form of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> pages.
        This module may be used with any GeoAPI implementation.
        For developers of a geospatial library, it offers the following advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces the tedious task of writing tests by using existing tests.</li>
        <li>Increases confidence in the validity of tests,
          since <code>geoapi-conformance</code> has its own test suite and is applied to other implementations.</li>
        <li>Facilitates comparison with other implementations.</li>
      </ul>



      <h3 id="GeoAPI-validators">Instance validations</h3>
      <p>
        GeoAPI can validate an instance of its interfaces by checking that certain constraints are observed.
        Many constraints can not be expressed in the method signature. Those constraints
        are usually described textually in the abstract specifications or in the javadoc.
      </p>
      <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
        A coordinate conversion or transformation (<code>CC_CoordinateOperation</code>) may require a sequence of several steps.
        In such a sequence of operations (<code>CC_ConcatenatedOperation</code>), for each step (<code>CC_SingleOperation</code>)
        the number of output dimensions must equal the number of input dimensions in the next operation.
        Expressed in Java, this constraint stipulates that for the entire index 0 &lt; <var>i</var> &lt; <var>n</var> where <var>n</var>
        is the number of operations, we have <code>coordOperation[i].targetDimensions == coordOperation[i-1].sourceDimensions</code>.
      </p></div>

      <p>
        The easiest way to perform these verifications is to call the static methods <code class="GeoAPI">validate(…)</code>
        of the <code>org.opengis.test.Validators</code> class.
        As all of <code>Validators</code> methods bear the same name, it is enough to write “<code>validate(<var>value</var>)</code>”
        and then let the compiler choose the most appropriate method for the type of object given in argument.
        If the object type is not known at the time of compilation,
        the <code class="GeoAPI">dispatch(Object)</code> method can be invoked for redirecting the work to the most appropriate <code class="GeoAPI">validate(…)</code> method.
      </p>
      <p>
        All <code class="GeoAPI">validate(…)</code> functions follow a chain of dependencies,
        meaning that they will also validate each component of the object to be validated.
        For example, the validation of a <code>GeographicCRS</code> implies the validation of its component
        <code>GeodeticDatum</code>, which itself implies the validation of its component <code>Ellipsoid</code>, and so on.
        Thus it is unnecessary to validate the components explicitely, unless the developer wishes to isolate the test for a particular item known to cause problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, validations are as strict as possible. It is always possible to relax certain rules.
        The most common is to tolerate the absence of attributes that would normally be mandatory.
        This rule and a few others may be modified globally for all tests executed by the currently running <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr>,
        as in the following example:
      </p>

<pre>import org.opengis.metadata.Metadata;
import org.opengis.test.Validators;
import org.junit.Test;

public class MyTest {
    /*
     * Tolerate the absence of mandatory attributes in metadata and citation packages.
     * This modification applies to all tests executed by the currently running <abbr>JVM</abbr>.
     * If there are multiple test classes, this initialization may be performed
     * in a parent class to all test classes.
     */
    static {
        Validators.<code class="GeoAPI">DEFAULT.metadata.requireMandatoryAttributes</code> = false;
        Validators.<code class="GeoAPI">DEFAULT.citation.requireMandatoryAttributes</code> = false;
    }

    @Test
    public void testMyMetadata() {
        Metadata myObject = …; // Create an object here.
        Validators.<code class="GeoAPI">validate</code>(myObject);
    }
}</pre>

      <p>
        Rules may also be modified for a particular test suite without affecting the default configuration of the standard <abbr>JVM</abbr>.
        This approach requires the creation of a new instance of the validator that we wish to modify the configuration.
      </p>

<pre>import org.opengis.metadata.Metadata;
import org.opengis.test.ValidatorContainer;
import org.junit.Test;

public class MyTest {
    private final ValidatorContainer validators;

    public MyTest() {
        validators = new ValidatorContainer();
        validators.<code class="GeoAPI">metadata.requireMandatoryAttributes</code> = false;
        validators.<code class="GeoAPI">citation.requireMandatoryAttributes</code> = false;
    }

    @Test
    public void testMyMetadata() {
        Metadata myObject = …; // Create an object here.
        validators.<code class="GeoAPI">validate</code>(myObject);
    }
}</pre>



      <h3 id="GeoAPI-tests">Executing pre-defined tests</h3>
      <p>
        JUnit tests are defined in the <code>org.opengis.test</code> sub-packages.
        All test classes bear a name ending in "<code>Test</code>".
        GeoAPI also provides an <code>org.opengis.test.TestSuite</code> class including all test classes defined in the
        <code>geoapi-conformance</code> module, but Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> does not use it.
        Instead, Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> inherits GeoAPI’s <code class="GeoAPI">*Test</code> classes on a case-by-case basis,
        in the appropriate modules.
        The example below gives an example of a customized GeoAPI test:
        The <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/geoapi-conformance/apidocs/org/opengis/test/referencing/ParameterizedTransformTest.html">parent test javadoc</a>
        documents the tests performed in detail.
        In this example, only one test is modified and all the others are inherited as they are (it is not necessary to repeat them in the sub-class).
        However, this example adds a supplemental verification, annotated with <code>@After</code>, which will be executed after each test.
      </p>

<pre>import org.junit.*;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.JUnit4;
import org.opengis.test.referencing.ParameterizedTransformTest;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

@RunWith(JUnit4.class)
public class MyTest extends ParameterizedTransformTest {
    /**
     * Specify our own coordinate transformation factory for the GeoAPI tests.
     * GeoAPI will test the objects created by this factory.
     */
    public MyTest() {
        super(new MyMathTransformFactory());
    }

    /**
     * Changes the behaviour of a test. This example relaxes the requirements of this test a little,
     * by accepting errors of up to 10 centimetres, rather than the default value of 1 cm.
     * This change only applies to this method, and does not affect the other inherited tests.
     */
    @Test
    @Override
    public void testLambertAzimuthalEqualArea() throws FactoryException, TransformException {
        <code class="GeoAPI">tolerance</code> = 0.1; // 10 cm tolerance.
        super.<code class="GeoAPI">testLambertAzimuthalEqualArea()</code>;
    }

    /**
     * Supplemental verification performed after each test, inherited or not.
     * In this example, we are verifying that the transformation tested
     * works correctly in two-dimensional spaces.
     */
    @After
    public void ensureAllTransformAreMath2D() {
        assertTrue(<code class="GeoAPI">transform</code> instanceof MathTransform2D);
    }
