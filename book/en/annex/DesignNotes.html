      <h3 id="AffineTransform">Affine transform</h3>
      <p>
        Among the many kinds of operations performed by <abbr>GIS</abbr> softwares on spatial coordinates,
        <cite>affine transforms</cite>  are both relatively simple and very common.
        Affine transforms can represent any combination of scales, shears, flips, rotations and translations,
        which are <em>linear</em> operations.
        Affine transforms can not handle <em>non-linear</em> operations like map projections,
        but the affine transform capabilities nevertheless cover many other cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Axis order changes,           for example from (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>) to (<var>longitude</var>, <var>latitude</var>).</li>
        <li>Axis direction changes,       for example the <var>y</var> axis oriented toward down in images.</li>
        <li>Prime meridian rotations,     for example from <cite>Paris</cite> to <cite>Greenwich</cite> prime meridian.</li>
        <li>Dimensionality changes,       for example from 3-dimensional coordinates to 2-dimensional coordinates by dropping the height.</li>
        <li>Unit conversion,              for example from feet to metres.</li>
        <li>Pixel to geodetic coordinate, for example the conversion represented in the <code>.tfw</code> files associated to some <abbr>TIFF</abbr> images.</li>
        <li>Part of map projections,      for example the <cite>False Easting</cite>, <cite>False Northing</cite> and <cite>Scale factor</cite> parameters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Affine transforms can be concatenated efficiently.
        No matter how many affine transforms are chained, the result can be represented by a single affine transform.
        This property is more easily seen when affine transforms are represented by matrices:
        in order to concatenate those operations, we only need to multiply those matrices.
        The “pixel to geographic coordinate conversions” case below gives an example.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <p><b>Example:</b>
          given an image with pixel coordinates represented by (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) tuples
          and given the following assumptions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is no shear, no rotation and no flip.</li>
          <li>All pixels have the same width in degrees of longitude.</li>
          <li>All pixels have the same height in degrees of latitude.</li>
          <li>Pixel indices are positive integers starting at (0,0) inclusive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then conversions from pixel coordinates (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>)
          to geographic coordinates (<var>λ</var>,<var>φ</var>) can be represented by the following equations,
          where <var>N</var><sub><var>x</var></sub> is the image width and
          <var>N</var><sub><var>y</var></sub> the image height in number of pixels:
        </p><p>
          <xi:include href="../../math/PixelToGeographicTerms.html"/>
        </p><p>
          Above equations can be represented in matrix form as below:
        </p><p>
        <xi:include href="../../math/PixelToGeographic.html"/>
        </p><p>
          In this particular case, scale factors <var>S</var> are the pixel size in degrees
          and translation terms <var>T</var> are the geographic coordinate of an image corner
          (not necessarily the lower-left corner if some axes have been flipped).
          This straightforward interpretation holds because of above-cited assumptions, but
          matrix coefficients become more complex if the image has shear or rotation
          or if pixel coordinates do not start at (0,0).
          However it is not necessary to use more complex equations for supporting more generic cases.
          The following example starts with an “initial conversion” matrix
          where the <var>S</var> and <var>T</var> terms are set to the most straightforward values.
          Then the <var>y</var> axis direction is reversed for matching the most common convention in image coordinate systems (change 1),
          and axis are swapped resulting in latitude before longitude (change 2).
          Note that when affine transform concatenations are written as matrix multiplications, operations are ordered from right to left:
          <var>A</var>×<var>B</var>×<var>C</var> is equivalent to first applying operation <var>C</var>,
          then operation <var>B</var> and finally operation <var>A</var>.
        </p>
        <table class="hidden"><tr>
          <th>Change 2</th><th></th>
          <th>Change 1</th><th></th>
          <th>Initial conversion</th><th></th>
          <th>Concatenated operation</th>
        </tr><tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: middle"><xi:include href="../../math/AxisSwapping2D.html"/></td>

          <td style="vertical-align: middle"><xi:include href="../../math/PixelToGeographicReverseOrderAndY.html"/></td>
        </tr></table>
        <p>
          A key principle is that there is no need to write Java code dedicated to above kinds of axis changes.
          Those operations, and many other, can be handled by matrix algebra.
          This approach makes easier to write generic code and improves performance.
          Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> follows this principle by using affine transforms for every operations
          that can be performed by such transform.
          For instance there is no code dedicated to changing order of ordinate values in a coordinate.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4 id="AffineTransformAPI">Integration with graphical libraries</h4>
      <p>
        About all graphical libraries support some kind of coordinate operations, usually as <cite>affine transforms</cite>
        or a slight generalization like <cite>perspective transforms</cite>.
        Each library defines its own <abbr>API</abbr>. Some examples are listed below:
      </p>
      <table>
        <caption>Affine transform implementations in graphical libraries</caption>
        <tr><th>Library</th>                                  <th>Transform implementation</th>                          <th>Dimensions</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Java2D</td>                                   <td><code>java.awt.geom.AffineTransform</code></td>        <td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Java3D</td>                                   <td><code>javax.media.j3d.Transform3D</code></td>          <td>3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>JavaFX</td>                                   <td><code>javafx.scene.transform.Affine</code></td>        <td>2 or 3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Java Advanced Imaging (<abbr>JAI</abbr>)</td> <td><code>javax.media.jai.PerspectiveTransform</code></td> <td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Android</td>                                  <td><code>android.graphics.Matrix</code></td>              <td>2</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        However in many cases, affine or perspective transforms are the only kind of coordinate operations supported by the graphical library.
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> needs to handle a wider range of operations, in which affine transforms are only special cases.
        In particular most map projections and datum shifts can not be represented by affine transforms.
        <abbr>SIS</abbr> also needs to support arbitrary number of dimensions,
        while above-cited <abbr>API</abbr> restrict the use to a fixed number of dimensions.
        For those reasons <abbr>SIS</abbr> can not use directly the above-cited <abbr>API</abbr>.
        Instead, <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses the more abstract <code>org.opengis.referencing.transform.MathTransform</code> interface.
        But in the special case where the transform is actually affine, <abbr>SIS</abbr> may try to use an existing implementation,
        in particular Java2D. The following Java code can be used in situations where the Java2D object is desired:
      </p>

<pre>MathTransform mt = ...;    // Any math transform created by Apache SIS.
if (mt instanceof AffineTransform) {
    AffineTransform at = (AffineTransform) mt;
    // Use Java2D API from here.
}</pre>

      <p>
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses Java2D on a <em>best effort</em> basis only.
        The above cast is not guaranteed to succeed,
        even when the <code>MathTransform</code> meets the requirements allowing Java2D usage.
      </p>


      <h3 id="MatrixLibrary">Specificities of a matrix library for <abbr>GIS</abbr></h3>
      <p>
        <abbr>GIS</abbr> make an extensive usage of matrices for displaying maps or for transforming coordinates.
        There is many excellent open source or commercial matrix libraries available.
        However, <abbr>GIS</abbr> have some specific needs that differ a little bit from the goals of many existent libraries.
        Matrix operations like those described in the <a href="#AffineTransform">affine transform chapter</a>
        appear in almost all coordinate operations applied by Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>.
        But the analysis of those operations reveal some patterns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Those matrices are almost always of small size, rarely more than 5 rows and 5 columns.</p></li>
        <li><p>“Heavy” matrix operations (matrix inversions or multiplications) do not happen in performance-critical code.
            In almost every cases, those heavy operations are executed only once, for example when a data file is read
            or in preparation steps before to transform coordinates.
            Those heavy operations rarely happen in the loop that apply the coordinate operation
            after we finished to prepare it.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a sequence of matrix multiplications or inversions, rounding errors accumulate and grow fast.
            If the sequence of matrix operations is long enough,
            rounding errors can become indistinguishable from real operations like datum shifts.
            This ambiguity can happen because the matrix representation of some datum shifts has small values,
            with scale factors of a few parts per million and rotation terms of a few arc-seconds.</p></li>
        <li><p>It is quite common that two affine transforms cancel each other when they are concatenated, i.e.
            that matrix multiplications result in some or all scale factors equal to 1 and some or all translation terms equal to 0.
            However because of rounding errors the results are rarely exact, but are rather some values like 0,9999…97 instead of 1.
            The usual workaround is to compare floating point numbers with some tolerance threshold.
            Unfortunately it is difficult to choose a threshold that catch a wide range of rounding errors
            without wrongly considering legitimate datum shifts as rounding errors (see previous point).</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a consequence of above points, accuracy of a matrix library is more important than performance for a <abbr>GIS</abbr> like Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>.
        Paradoxically, a good way to improve performance is to invest more CPU time for more accurate matrix operations
        when <em>preparing</em> (not <em>executing</em>) the coordinate operation,
        because it increases the chances to correctly detect which operations cancel each other.
        This investment can save execution time at the place where it matters most:
        in the code looping over millions of coordinates to transform.
      </p><p>
        However matrix libraries are often designed for high performances with large matrices, sometime containing thousands of rows and columns.
        Those libraries can efficiently resolve systems of linear equations with hundreds of unknown variables.
        Those libraries resolve difficult problems, but not of the same kind than the problems that Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> needs to solve.
        For that reason, and also for another reason described in next paragraphs, Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses its own matrix implementation.
        This implementation addresses the accuracy issue by using “double-double” arithmetic
        (a technic for simulating the accuracy of approximatively 120 bits wide floating point numbers)
        at the cost of performance in a phase (transform <em>preparation</em>) where performance is not considered critical.
      </p>

      <h4 id="NonSquareMatrix">What to do with non-square matrices (and why)</h4>
      <p>
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> often needs to inverse matrices, in order to perform a coordinate operation in reverse direction.
        Matrix inversions are typically performed on square matrices, but <abbr>SIS</abbr> also needs to inverse non-square matrices.
        Depending on whether we have more lines than columns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>From Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> library perspective, a non-square matrix is a coordinate operation that adds or removes a dimension.</li>
        <li>From linear algebra libraries perspective, a non-square matrix is an under-determined or over-determined system of equations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To illustrate the issues caused by direct use of libraries designed for linear algebra,
        consider a (<var>φ₁</var>, <var>λ₁</var>, <var>h</var>) → (<var>φ₂</var>, <var>λ₂</var>) conversion
        from three-dimensional points to two-dimensional points on a surface.
        The <var>φ</var> terms are latitudes, the <var>λ</var> terms are longitudes and
        (<var>φ₂</var>, <var>λ₂</var>) may be different than (<var>φ₁</var>, <var>λ₁</var>) if <var>h</var> axis is not perpendicular to the surface.
      </p><p>
        <xi:include href="../../math/Geographic3Dto2D.html"/>
      </p><p>
        For linear algebra libraries, the above non-square matrix represents an under-determined system of equations and may be considered unresolvable.
        Indeed the above coordinate operation can not be inverted as a (<var>φ₂</var>, <var>λ₂</var>) → (<var>φ₁</var>, <var>λ₁</var>, <var>h</var>)
        operation because we do not know which value to assign to <var>h</var>.
        Ignoring <var>h</var> implies that we can not assign values to (<var>φ₁</var>, <var>λ₁</var>) neither since those values may depend on <var>h</var>.
        However in <abbr>GIS</abbr> case, the ellipsoidal <var>h</var> axis is perpendicular to the ellipsoid surface
        on which the <em>geodetic</em> latitudes and longitudes (<var>φ</var>, <var>λ</var>) are represented
        (note that this statement is not true for <em>geocentric</em> latitudes and longitudes).
        This perpendicularity makes <var>φ₁</var> and <var>λ₁</var> independent of <var>h</var>.
        In such cases, we can can still do some processing.
      </p><p>
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> proceeds by checking if <var>h</var> values are independent of <var>φ</var> and <var>λ</var> values.
        We identify such cases by checking which matrix coefficients are zero.
        If <abbr>SIS</abbr> can identify independent dimensions, it can temporarily exclude those dimensions
        and invert the matrix using only the remaining dimensions.
        If <abbr>SIS</abbr> does not found a sufficient amount of independent dimensions, an exception is thrown.
        But if a matrix inversion has been possible, then we need to decide which value to assign to the dimensions that <abbr>SIS</abbr> temporarily excluded.
        By default, <abbr>SIS</abbr> assigns the <code>NaN</code> (<cite>Not-a-Number</cite>) value to those dimensions.
        However in the particular case of ellipsoidal height <var>h</var> in a (<var>φ₂</var>, <var>λ₂</var>) → (<var>φ₁</var>, <var>λ₁</var>, <var>h</var>) operation,
        the zero value may also be appropriate on the assumption that the coordinates are usually close to the ellipsoid surface.
        In any case, the coefficients that Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> sets to zero or <code>NaN</code> is based on the assumption
        that the matrix represents a coordinate operation; this is not something that can be done with arbitrary matrices.
      </p><p>
        The above-described approach allows Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> to resolve some under-determined equation systems commonly found in <abbr>GIS</abbr>.
        In our example using <code>NaN</code> as the default value, the <var>h</var> ordinate stay unknown – we do not create information from nothing –
        but at least the (<var>φ</var>, <var>λ</var>) coordinates are preserved.
        The opposite problem, those of over-determined equation systems, is more subtile.
        An approach commonly applied by linear algebra libraries is to resolve over-determined systems by the least squares method.
        Such method applied to our example would compute a (<var>φ₂</var>, <var>λ₂</var>, <var>h</var>) → (<var>φ₁</var>, <var>λ₁</var>) operation
        that seems the best compromise for various <var>φ₂</var>, <var>λ₂</var> and <var>h</var> values,
        while being (except special cases) an exact solution for no-one.
        Furthermore linear combinations between those three variables may be an issue because of heterogenous units of measurement,
        for instance with <var>h</var> in metres and (<var>φ</var>, <var>λ</var>) in degrees.
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> rather proceeds in the same way than for under-determined systems:
        by requiring that some dimensions are independent from other dimensions, otherwise the matrix is considered non-invertible.
        Consequently in over-determined systems case, <abbr>SIS</abbr> may refuse to perform some matrix inversions that linear algebra libraries can do,
        but in case of success the resulting coordinate operation is guaranteed to be exact (ignoring rounding errors).
      </p>
