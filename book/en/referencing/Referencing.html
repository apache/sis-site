      <p>
        For locating a point on Earth one can use identifiers like city name or postal address
        — an approach known as <cite>spatial reference systems by identifiers</cite> —
        or use numerical values valid in a given coordinate system like latitudes and longitudes
        — an approach known as <cite>spatial reference systems by coordinates</cite>.
        Each reference system implies approximations like
        the choice of a figure of the Earth (geoid, ellipsoid, <i>etc.</i>) used as an approximation of Earth shape,
        the choice of geometric properties (angles, distances, <i>etc.</i>) to be preserved when a map is shown on plane surface, and
        a lost of precision when coordinates are transformed to systems using a different <a href="#GeodeticDatum">datum</a>.
      </p><p>
        A very common misbelief is that one can avoid this complexity by using a single coordinate reference system
        (typically <abbr title="World Geodetic System 1984">WGS84</abbr>) as a universal system for all data.
        The next chapters will explain why the reality is not so simple.
        Whether a universal reference system can suit an application needs or not depends on the desired positional accuracy
        and the kind of calculations to be performed with the data.
        Unless otherwise specified, Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> aims to represent coordinates on Earth with an accuracy of one centimetre or better.
        But the accuracy can be altered by various situations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Points should be inside the domain of validity as given by <code>ReferenceSystem.getDomainOfValidity()</code>.</li>
        <li>Distance measurements in a given map projection are true only is some special locations,
            named for instance “standards parallels”.</li>
        <li>Positional accuracy is altered after coordinate transformations.
            The new accuracy is described by <code>CoordinateOperation.getCoordinateOperationAccuracy()</code>.</li>
        <li>Finding the most appropriate coordinate transformation parameters require the use of a geodetic dataset like <abbr>EPSG</abbr>.
            Declaring those parameters within the <abbr>CRS</abbr> (for example with a <code>TOWGS84</code> element) is often not sufficient.</li>
      </ul>

          <h2>“Early binding” versus “late binding” implementations</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Because of the <abbr>WGS84</abbr> ubiquity, it is tempting to use that system as a hub or a pivot system
          for all coordinate transformations.
          The use of an “universal” system as a pivot simplifies the design of coordinate transformations libraries.
          For example transformations from datum <var>A</var> to datum <var>B</var> can be done by first transforming
          from <var>A</var> to <abbr>WGS84</abbr>, then from <abbr>WGS84</abbr> to <var>B</var>.
          With such approach, a coordinate transformations library would only need to associate each
          <code>GeodeticDatum</code> instance with the transformation parameters from that datum to <abbr>WGS84</abbr>.
          This approach was encouraged in version 1 of <abbr>WKT</abbr> format, since that format specified a
          <code>TOWGS84[…]</code> element (removed in <abbr>WKT</abbr> version 2) precisely for that purpose.
          This approach is known in <abbr>EPSG</abbr> guidance notes as “early binding” implementations
          since information about coordinate transformations are associated early in geodetic object definitions,
          usually right at <code>GeographicCRS</code> creation time.
          While <abbr>EPSG</abbr> acknowledges that this approach is commonly used,
          this is not a recommended strategy for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>More than one transformation may exist from datum <var>A</var> to datum <var>B</var>,
              where each transformation is designed for a different geographic area.</li>
          <li>Some operations are designed specifically for transformations from <var>A</var> to <var>B</var>
              and do not have the same accuracy than an operation using <abbr>WGS84</abbr> as an intermediate step.</li>
          <li><abbr>WGS84</abbr> itself has been updated many times,
              which makes it a kind of moving target (admittedly slowly) for coordinate transformations libraries.</li>
          <li>Different systems could be used as the pivot system, for example the <cite>Galileo Reference Frame</cite>
              (<abbr>GTRF</abbr>) created for the European <abbr>GPS</abbr> competitor.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
          the <abbr>EPSG</abbr> geodetic dataset defines about 50 transformations from <abbr>NAD27</abbr> to <abbr>NAD83</abbr>.
          In an early binding approach, the same geographic <abbr>CRS</abbr> (namely “<abbr>NAD27</abbr>”) in the <abbr>WKT</abbr> 1
          format would need to be defined with a <code>TOWGS84[-8, 160, 176]</code> element for coordinates in <abbr>USA</abbr>
          or with a <code>TOWGS84[-10, 158, 187]</code> element for coordinates in Canada.
          Different parameter values exist for other regions like Cuba, so it is not possible to represent such diversity
          with a single <code>TOWGS84[…]</code> element associated to a <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
          But even when restricting <abbr>CRS</abbr> usage to the domain of validity of its single <code>TOWGS84[…]</code> element,
          those transformations are still approximative with a 10 metres accuracy in the <abbr>USA</abbr> case.
          More accurate transformations exist in the form of <abbr>NADCON</abbr> grid shift files,
          but those transformations are from <abbr>NAD27</abbr> to <abbr>NAD83</abbr> (which move together on the same continental plate),
          not to <abbr>WGS84</abbr> (which move independently).
          The difference was often ignored when <abbr>NAD83</abbr> and <abbr>WGS84</abbr> were considered as practically equivalent,
          but that assumption is subject to more caution today.
        </p></div>
        <p>
          <abbr>EPSG</abbr> rather recommends the use of “late binding” approach,
          in which coordinate transformation methods and parameters are defined for
          “<var>A</var> to <var>B</var>” pairs of systems (eventually completed with domain of validity)
          rather than associated to standalone datums.
          Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> is a “late binding” implementation,
          while some reminiscences of “early binding” approach still exist in the form of the
          <code>DefaultGeodeticDatum.getBursaWolfParameters()</code> property.
          The later is used only if <abbr>SIS</abbr> fails to apply the late binding approach for given reference systems.

      <p>
        The <code>sis-referencing</code> module provides a set of classes implementing
        different specializations of the <code>ReferenceSystem</code> interface, together with required components.
        Those implementations store spatial reference system descriptions, together with metadata like their domain of validity.
        However those objects do not perform any operation on coordinate values.
        Coordinates <cite>conversions</cite> or <cite>transformations</cite> are performed by another family of types,
        with <code>CoordinateOperation</code> as the root interface.
        Those types will be discussed in <a href="#CoordinateOperation">another section</a>.
