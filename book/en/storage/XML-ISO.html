        <h2 id="XML-ISO">Representing objects in <abbr>XML</abbr></h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Objects defined by <abbr>OGC</abbr>/<abbr>ISO</abbr> standards must be able to communicate with remote machines via the Internet,
        using different software written in different languages.
        Some of the better known formats include <abbr>WKT</abbr> (<i>Well-Known Text</i>) and <abbr>WKB</abbr> (<i>Well-Known Binary</i>).
        But the most exhaustive and often referred format is <abbr>XML</abbr>,
        to the point where the representation of <abbr>ISO</abbr> objects in this format is itself sometimes
        the entire focus of an international standard.
        Thus are metadata classes described in <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19115-1 standard (an abstract specification),
        while the representation of these classes in <abbr>XML</abbr> is described in <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19115-3 and 19139 standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different <abbr>OGC</abbr>/<abbr>ISO</abbr> standards do not always use the same strategy to express objects in <abbr>XML</abbr>.
        <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19115-3 standard in particular uses a more verbose approach than other standards,
        and will be the subject of its <a href="#XML-ISO-19115">own section</a>.
        But most <abbr>XML</abbr> formats define supplementary types and attributes that are not part of the original abstract specifications.
        These supplementary attributes are usually specific to <abbr>XML</abbr> and may not appear in the <abbr>API</abbr> of Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>.
        However, some of these attributes, such as <code class="OGC">id</code>, <code class="OGC">uuid</code> and
        <code>xlink:href</code>, remain accessible in the form of key-value pairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <abbr>XML</abbr> documents may use any prefixes,
        but the following prefixes are commonly used.
        They therefore appear by default in documents produced by Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>.
        These prefixes are defined in the <code>org.apache.sis.xml.Namespaces</code> class.
      </p>

        <h2>Tools for reading and writing <abbr>XML</abbr> documents</h2>
        <p>
          Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses different libraries to read and write different types of objects.
          The library used depends on the complexity of the object and on performance constraints.
          For example, <abbr title="Java Architecture for XML Binding">JAXB</abbr> annotations have the advantage of being close to code,
          which makes it easier to maintain mapping between Java and <abbr>XML</abbr>.
          On the other hand, <abbr title="Simple API for XML">SAX</abbr> is more efficient.
          In general, Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <abbr>JAXB</abbr> for objects that do not occur very often in <abbr>XML</abbr> documents, but with complex structures and deep hierarchies.
            The metadata set in <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19115-3 standard is a typical example
          </li>
          <li>
            <abbr>SAX</abbr> for objects that are relatively simple, but which may exist in very large numbers.
            The set of points in a geometry is a typical example.
          </li>
          <li>
            <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> as an alternative to <abbr>JAXB</abbr>
            when the <abbr>XML</abbr> elements do not correspond exactly to Java attributes.
            <i>Features</i> are an example, as their structure is dynamic.
          </li>
        </ul>
