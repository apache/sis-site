    <p>
      A geospatial information community is a collection of systems or individuals capable of exchanging their geospatial data
      through the use of common standards, allowing them to communicate with one another.
      As there are many ways to represent geospatial information, each community tends to structure this information in light of its areas of interest.
      This diversity complicates the task of Spatial Information System (<abbr>SIS</abbr>) users
      by confronting them with an apparently chaotic variety of data formats and structures.
      The characteristics of these structures vary according to the observed phenomenon and measurement methods,
      as well as the habits of the organizations producing the data.
      Such a variety represents an obstacle in studies that require heterogeneous combinations of data,
      especially when they originate in communities that are traditionally distinct.
      For example, a researcher studying cholera might be interested in populations of shrimp as a propagation vector of the disease.
      But as doctors and oceanographers may not be used to share their work,
      the participants of such a study may be limited by the effort required to convert the data.
    </p><p>
      We cannot impose a uniform format on all data collections, as the diversity of formats is tied to factors
      such as the constraints imposed by the measuring apparatus, and the statistical distribution of values.
      A more flexible solution is to ensure the interoperability of data across a common programming interface
      (<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>).
      This <abbr>API</abbr> is not necessarily defined in a programming language;
      the actual tendency is rather to define conventions that use existing web protocols, which we can translate into various programming languages.
      But in order for this approach to be viable, the <abbr>API</abbr> must be generally accepted by independent developers.
      In other words, the <abbr>API</abbr> must come as near as possible to industrial standards.
    </p><p>
      For example, one task that benefit from a successful standardization is the accessing of relational databases.
      The industry has established a common language — the <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> standard —
      that the creators of Java have embedded in standard <abbr title="Java DataBase Connectivity">JDBC</abbr> programming interfaces.
      Today, these interfaces are implemented by many software programs, both free and commercial.
      Like databases, methods of accessing geographic information have been standardized.
      In this case, however, the efforts have been more recent, and their integration in software — especially in older programs — is incomplete and not always coherent.
      At the time of writing, no product to our knowledge has implemented all of the specifications in their entirety.
      However, there are many implementations that cover a fairly large spectrum.
      One of these is the Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>® library that is described in this document.
    </p><p>
      Apache <abbr title="Spatial Information System">SIS</abbr> is characterized by a sustained effort to comply with standards.
      In general, complying with standards demands a greater effort than would be required for an isolated development,
      but rewards us with a double advantage: not only does it improve the interoperability of our data with that of external projects,
      it also points towards a robust way of elaborating the conceptual model reflected in the <abbr>API</abbr>.
      In effect, the groups of experts who conceived the standards anticipated difficulties that sometimes escape the engineer at the beginning of a project,
      but which risk to hit them before the end.
    </p>



    <h2 id="Standards">Standards and Norms</h2>
    <p>
      Most standards used by Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> have been devised by the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> (<abbr>OGC</abbr>),
      sometimes in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.iso.org">International Organization for Standardization</a> (<abbr>ISO</abbr>).
      Some <abbr>ISO</abbr> standards themselves become European standards via the <a href="http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu">INSPIRE Directive</a>.
      These standards offer two key features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Allowing a community to make its information public in such a way that outside individuals or systems can discover it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transferring information from one community to another while preserving its semantics,
        even if the two communities use very different internal representations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These standards are made available to the international community for free,
      as <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/is">specifications (<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> files)</a> or
      as <a href="http://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.3/">schemas (<abbr title="XML Schema Definition">XSD</abbr> files)</a>.
      Standardization organizations do not create software; to obtain an implementation of these specifications,
      users must choose one of the compliant products available on the market, or develop their own solutions.
      Such voluntary compliance with these specifications allow independent communities to more easily exchange geographic information.
    </p><p>
      Besides these formal standardization organizations, there are organizations that are not officially dedicated
      to the creation of standards, but whose work has largely been adopted as <i>de facto</i> standards.
      In particular, the <a href="http://www.epsg.org">EPSG</a> database offers numeric codes which allow the easy identification of a
      Coordinates Reference System (<abbr>CRS</abbr>) among <a href="../sis-referencing/supported-codes.html">several thousand</a>.
      This database is offered by petroleum companies that have an interest in ensuring their explorations are conducted in the correct place,
      even when using map produced by another party.
      Other examples of <i>de facto</i> standards include <a href="http://geotiff.osgeo.org">GeoTIFF</a> for data distributed on a grid (such as images),
      and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">Shapefile</a> for vector data (such as geometric shapes).
    </p>



    <article id="OGC-process">
      <header>
        <h1><abbr>OGC</abbr> Standardization Process</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        The work of the <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> is done by email, teleconferences, and at <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/event?category=ogctcpc">in-person meetings</a>.
        The <abbr>OGC</abbr> organizes four meetings per year, each lasting five days, and hosted by member organizations that sponsor the event (companies, universities, research centres, <i>etc</i>).
        The host continent alternates between Europe and North America, with a growing presence in Asia since 2011.
        These meetings are usually attended by between 50 and 100 participants from among the hundreds of members of the <abbr>OGC</abbr>.
        Some participants are present at almost all the meetings, forming the pillars of the organization.
        The meetings of the <abbr>OGC</abbr> offer opportunities for exchange among members from diverse backgrounds.
      </p><p>
        The creation of a <abbr>OGC</abbr> standard begins with a gathering of organizations or individuals with a common interest in an issue.
        A working group is proposed as a <i>Domain Working Group</i> (<abbr>DWG</abbr>) or as a <i>Standard Working Group</i> (<abbr>SWG</abbr>).
        <abbr>DWG</abbr>s are open to all members of the <abbr>OGC</abbr>,
        while <abbr>SWG</abbr>s require that their participants enter into an agreement not to hinder the distribution of the standard through intellectual property claims.
      </p>

      <h2 id="OGC-SWG">Standard Working Group (<abbr>SWG</abbr>) Procedures</h2>
      <p>
        In order to be accepted, a standardization project must be supported by a minimum number of members belonging to distinct organizations.
        These founding members draft a charter defining the objectives of the <abbr>SWG</abbr>,
        which must be approved by the Technical Committee of the <abbr>OGC</abbr>.
        Each founding member is endowed with the right to vote, with a limit of one voting member per organization.
        Each new member that wishes to join the <abbr>SWG</abbr> after its creation is granted the role of observer,
        and receives on request the right to vote after several months of observation.
      </p><p>
        A <abbr>SWG</abbr> may contain several dozen members, but the volunteers performing the bulk of the work are usually fewer.
        Their proposals are submitted to the entire membership of the group, who may accept them by unanimous consent.
        Any objections must be debated, and an alternative proposed.
        <abbr>SWG</abbr>s usually try to debate an issue until a consensus emerges rather than move ahead despite negative votes,
        even if those opposed are in a minority.
        The decisions of the group are then integrated into the specifications by a member who assumes the role of editor.
      </p><p>
        As far as possible, the working group must structure the specifications as a core around which various extensions might be built.
        A series of tests must accompany the standard, allowing implementations to be classified by the level of test passed.
        There must be at least one <i>reference implementation</i> that passes all the tests in order to demonstrate that the standard is usable.
      </p><p>
        When the standard is considered ready, the <abbr>SWG</abbr> votes on a motion proposing its submission to a vote by the higher authorities of the <abbr>OGC</abbr>.
        This process takes several months. There is a faster process for approving <i>de facto</i> standards, but it is applied sparingly.
      </p>

      <h2 id="OGC-OAB">The Architecture Board (<abbr>OAB</abbr>) and the Technical Committee (<abbr>TC</abbr>)</h2>
      <p>
        All proposals for standards are first examined by the <abbr>OGC</abbr> Architecture Board (<abbr>OAB</abbr>).
        This board ensures that the standard conforms to the requirements of the <abbr>OGC</abbr> in form,
        modularization, and in terms of integration with other standards.
        If the <abbr>OAB</abbr> approves it, the standard is next submitted to a vote by the members of the Technical Committee (<abbr>TC</abbr>).
        This committee consists of the principal members of the <abbr>OGC</abbr>, and only they are capable of granting final approval.
        If approved, the standard is made publicly available for comments during a period of several months.
        At the end of this period, the <abbr title="Standard Working Group">SWG</abbr> must examine and respond to each comment.
        The eventual modifications of the standard are submitted to the <abbr>OAB</abbr>, then the standard is published in its final form.
        This distribution is announced in a press release by the <abbr>OGC</abbr>.
      </p><p>
        Certain members of the <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> and the <abbr title="Technical Committee">TC</abbr>
        also act as liaisons with the International Organization for Standardization (<abbr>ISO</abbr>).
        Cooperation between the two organizations goes two ways:
        the <abbr>OGC</abbr> adopts the <abbr>ISO</abbr> standards as a foundation on which to develop new standards,
        and certain <abbr>OGC</abbr> standards become <abbr>ISO</abbr> standards.
      </p>

      <h2 id="OGC-RFC">Procedure for the Submission of Proposals for Modification</h2>
      <p>
        All users, whether or not they are members of the Open Geospatial Consortium, may propose modifications to <abbr>OGC</abbr> standards.
        A list of current proposals for changes, along with a form for submitting new proposals, is <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cr">available online</a>.
        Each proposal is reviewed by the <abbr title="Standard Working Group">SWG</abbr>.
      </p><p>
        Some working groups use other parallel systems for submissions, for example GitHub merge requests, hosted outside of the structures of the <abbr>OGC</abbr>.
      </p>
    </article>


    <h3 id="SpecificationTypes">Different Types of Specifications</h3>
    <p>
      <abbr>OGC</abbr> standards are specified in several dozen documents.
      Each document outlines a service — for example, the transformation of coordinates.
      The function of each service is described by a collection of object classes and their interactions.
      These elements are illustrated by <abbr>UML</abbr> (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams in specifications called “abstracts”.
    </p><p>
      <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/as">Abstract specifications</a> do not refer to any specific computer language.
      Their concepts may be applied more or less directly to a programming language, a database or an <abbr>XML</abbr> schema.
      There is always an element of arbitrariness in the method of applying an abstract specification,
      given that adjustments are often necessary to take into account the constraints or conventions of the target language.
      Certain data structures only exist in a few languages — for example, unions that exist in C/C++ but not in Java.
    </p><p>
      At the turn of the millennium, the abstract specifications were explicitly concretized in <i>implementation specifications</i>.
      The term “implementation” is used here in the sense of all types of interfaces (Java or others) derived from
      <abbr title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</abbr> diagrams, and not implementations in the Java sense.
      Such specifications existed for <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>,
      <abbr title="Common Object Request Broker Architecture">CORBA</abbr>, <abbr title="Component Object Model">COM</abbr>, and Java languages.
      As these languages are capable of executing procedures, the specifications of this period define not only data structures,
      but also operations that apply to these structures.
    </p><p>
      Thereafter, enthusiasm for “Web 2.0” increased interest for <abbr>XML</abbr> over other languages.
      Older implementation specifications were deprecated,
      and <abbr title="XML Schema Definition">XSD</abbr> schemas became the main concretization of abstract specifications.
      Even the way abstract specifications are designed has evolved: they are less likely to define operations, and so what remains is closer to descriptions of database schemas.
      Some operations that were defined in older standards now appear, in another form, in web service specifications.
      Finally, the term “implementation specification” has been deprecated, to be subsumed under the term “<abbr>OGC</abbr> standard.”
      But despite their depreciation, <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/retired">old implementation specifications</a> remain useful to programs in Java, because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Their simpler models, applied to the same concepts, are helpful in understanding new specifications.</li>
      <li>They sometimes define easy ways to perform common tasks, where the newer specifications limit themselves to general cases.</li>
      <li>As operations are more often omitted from the newer specifications, the old ones remain a useful supplement when defining <abbr>API</abbr>s.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> project is based on the most recent specifications,
      drawing from the archives of the <abbr>OGC</abbr> to complete certain abstract standards or make them more usable.
      Some old definitions are preserved as “convenience methods”, not always bringing new functionality, but facilitating the practical use of a library.
    </p><p>
      The following table lists the main norms used by the project.
      Many norms are published both as <abbr>ISO</abbr> standards and as <abbr>OGC</abbr> standards,
      and their corresponding names are listed next to one another in the first two columns.
      Standards that are deprecated but still used appear <s>struck through</s>.
      Finally, GeoAPI packages will be introduced in upcoming chapters.

    <h3 id="DefinitionOfTerms">Definition of Terms</h3>
    <p>
      Standards sometimes favour the application of certain generic terms to particular contexts,
      which may differ from the context in which other communities use these terms.
      For example, the terms <i>domain</i> and <i>range</i> may apply to arbitrary functions in order to designate
      a set of possible values of inputs and outputs respectively.
      But the functions to which they are applied by certain <abbr>ISO</abbr> standards are not the same as the functions to which they are applied by other libraries.
      For example, <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19123 applies these terms to <code class="OGC">CV_Coverage</code> objects,
      seen as functions in which the <i>domain</i> is the set of spatio-temporal coordinates encompassed by the data,
      and the <i>range</i> is the set of values encompassed.
      But <abbr title="University Corporation for Atmospheric Research">UCAR</abbr>'s <abbr title="Network Common Data Form">NetCDF</abbr> library
      applies these terms instead to the function of converting pixel indices (its <i>domain</i>) to spatial-temporal coordinates (its <i>range</i>).
      Thus the <abbr>UCAR</abbr> library's <i>range</i> may be the <i>domain</i> of <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19123.
    </p><p>
      The Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> library prefers as much as possible to use terms in the sense of <abbr>OGC</abbr> and <abbr>ISO</abbr> norms.
      Particular care must be taken, however, with the interfaces between <abbr>SIS</abbr> and certain other external libraries,
      in order to reduce the risk of confusion.
