    </header>
    <p>
      This chapter introduces a few aspects of <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19107 standard (<i>Spatial schema</i>)
      and the Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> classes that implement them.
    </p>



    <h2 id="Geometry-root">Base Classes</h2>
    <p>
      Each geometric object is considered an infinite set of points.
      As a set, their most fundamental operations are of the same nature as the standard operations of Java collections.
      We may therefore see a geometry as a kind of <code>java.util.Set</code> in which the elements are points,
      except that the number of elements contained in the set is infinite (with the exception of geometries representing a simple point).
      To better represent this concept, the <abbr>ISO</abbr> standard and GeoAPI define a <code class="OGC">TransfiniteSet</code> interface
      which we could see as a <code>Set</code> of infinite size.
      Although a parent relationship exists conceptually between these interfaces,
      GeoAPI does not define <code class="GeoAPI">TransfiniteSet</code> as a sub-interface of <code>java.util.Set</code>,
      as the definition of certain methods such as <code>size()</code> and <code>iterator()</code> would be problematic.
      However, we find very similar methods such as <code class="GeoAPI">contains(…)</code> and <code class="GeoAPI">intersects(…)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All geometries are specializations of <code>TransfiniteSet</code>.
      The parent class of those geometries is called <code>GM_Object</code> in <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19107 standard.
      GeoAPI interfaces use the <code>Geometry</code> name instead, as the omission of the <code class="OGC">GM_</code>
      prefix (as prescribed in GeoAPI convention) would leave a name too similar to Java's <code>Object</code> class.
    </p>



    <h3 id="DirectPosition">Direct Points and Positions</h3>
    <p>
      <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19107 defines two types of structures to represent a point:
      <code>GM_Point</code> and <code class="OGC">DirectPosition</code>.
      The first type is a true geometry and may therefore be relatively cumbersome, depending on the implementation.
      The second type is not formally considered to be a geometry;
      it extends neither <code>GM_Object</code> nor <code class="OGC">TransfiniteSet</code>.
      It barely defines any operations besides the storing of a sequence of numbers representing a coordinate.
      It may therefore be a more lightweight object.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to allow the <abbr>API</abbr> to work equally with these two types of positions,
      <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19107 defines <code class="OGC">Position</code> as a <cite>union</cite> of
      <code class="OGC">DirectPosition</code> and <code>GM_Point</code>.
      It is a union in the sense of C/C++. For the Java language, GeoAPI obtains the same effect by defining
      <code>Position</code> as the parent interface of <code>DirectPosition</code> and <code>Point</code>.
      In practice, the great majority of Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>'s <abbr>API</abbr> works on <code>DirectPosition</code>s,
      or occasionally on <code>Position</code>s when it seems useful to also allow geometric points.
    </p>



    <h3 id="Envelope">Envelopes</h3>
    <p>
      Envelopes store minimal and maximal coordinate values of a geometry.
      Envelopes are <em>not</em> geometries themselves; they are not infinite sets of points (<code class="OGC">TransfiniteSet</code>).
      There is no guarantee that all the positions contained within the limits of an envelope are geographically valid.
      Envelopes must be seen as information about extreme values that might take the coordinates of a geometry as if
      each dimension were independent of the others, nothing more.
      Nevertheless, we speak of envelopes as rectangles, cubes or hyper-cubes (depending on the number of dimensions)
      in order to facilitate discussion, while bearing in mind their non-geometric nature.
    </p>
    <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
      We could test whether a position is within the limits of an envelope.
      A positive result does not guarantee that the position is within the geometry delimited by the envelope,
      but a negative result guarantees that it is outside the envelope.
      We can perform intersection tests in the same way.
      On the other hand, it makes little sense to apply a rotation to an envelope,
      as the result may be very different from that which we would obtain be performing a rotation on the original geometry,
      and then recalculating its envelope.
    </p></div>
    <p>
      An envelope might be represented by two positions corresponding to two opposite corners of a rectangle,
      cube or hyper-cube.
      For the first corner, we often take the one whose ordinates all have the maximal value (<code class="OGC">upperCorner</code>).
      When displayed using a conventional system of coordinates (with <var>y</var> axis values running upwards),
      these two positions appear respectively in the lower left corner and the upper right corner of a rectangle.
      Care must be taken with different coordinate systems, however, which may vary the positions of these corners on the screen.
      The expressions <i>lower corner</i> and <i>upper corner</i> should thus be understood in the mathematical rather than the visual sense.
    </p>



    <h4 id="AntiMeridian">Envelopes that Cross the Antimeridian</h4>
    <p>
      Minimums and maximums are the values most often assigned to <code class="OGC">lowerCorner</code>
      and <code class="OGC">upperCorner</code>.
      But the situation becomes complicated when an envelope crosses the antimeridian (-180° or 180° longitude).
      For example, an envelope 10° in size may begin at 175° longitude and end at -175°.
      In this case, the longitude value assigned to <code class="OGC">lowerCorner</code> is greater than that assigned to <code class="OGC">upperCorner</code>.
      Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> therefore uses a slightly different definition of these two corners:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><code class="SIS">lowerCorner</code>:</b>
        the starting point, if we move along the inside of the envelope in the direction of ascending values.
      </li>
      <li><b><code class="SIS">upperCorner</code>:</b>
        the end-point, if we move along the inside of the envelope in the direction of ascending values.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If the envelope does not cross the antimeridian, these two definitions are equivalent to the selection of minimal and
      maximal values respectively. This is the case in the green rectangle in the figure below.
      When the envelope crosses the antimeridian, the <code class="SIS">lowerCorner</code> and the
      <code class="SIS">upperCorner</code> appear again at the bottom and top of the rectangle
      (assuming a standard system of coordinates), so their names remain appropriate from a visual standpoint.
      However, the left and right positions are switched.
      This case is illustrated by the red rectangle in the figure below.
    </p>
    <center>
      <img src="../../apidocs/org/apache/sis/geometry/doc-files/AntiMeridian.png"
           alt="Envelope example with and without anti-meridian spanning."/>
    </center>
    <p>
      The notions of inclusion and intersection, however, interpreted slightly differently in these two cases.
      In the usual case where we do not cross the antimeridian, the green rectangle covers a region of inclusion.
      The regions excluded from this rectangle continue on to infinity in all directions.
      In other words, the region of inclusion is not repeated every 360°.
      But in the case of the red rectangle, the information provided by the envelope actually covers a region of exclusion
      between the two edges of the rectangle. The region of inclusion extends to infinity to the left and right.
      We could stipulate that all longitudes below -180° or above 180° are considered excluded,
      but this would be an arbitrary decision that would not be an exact counterpart to the usual case (green rectangle).
      A developer may wish to use these values, for example, in a mosaic where the map of the world is repeated several times
      horizontally and each repetition is considered distinct.
      If developers wish to perform operations as though the regions of inclusion or exclusion were repeated every 360°,
      they themselves will have to bring the longitudinal values between -180° and 180° in advance.
      All the <code class="SIS">add(…)</code>, <code class="SIS">contains(…)</code>,
      <code class="SIS">intersect(…)</code>, etc. functions of all the envelopes defined in the
      <code>org.apache.sis.geometry</code> package perform their calculations according to this convention.
    </p>

      <h5>Generalizing to Other Types of Axes</h5>
      <p>
        This section specifically relates to longitude, as it is the most usual example of a cyclic axis.
        However, in Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> envelopes, there is no explicit mention of longitude, or of its 360° cycle.
        The characteristics of the range of values of each axis (its extremum, units, type of cycle, etc.)
        are attributes of <code>CoordinateSystemAxis</code> objects,
        indirectly associated with envelopes via the coordinate reference system.
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> inspects these attributes to determine the way in which it must perform these operations.
        Thus, any axis associated with the code <code>RangeMeaning.WRAPAROUND</code> benefit from
        the same treatment as does longitude.
        For example, this could be a time axis for climatological data (one “year” represents the average temperature in all the
        months of January, followed by the average of all the months of February, etc.)
        This generalization also applies to longitude axes defined by a range of 0° to 360° rather than -180° to 180°.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      In order for functions such as <code class="SIS">add(…)</code> to work correctly,
      all objects involved must use the same coordinate reference system, including the same range of values.
      Thus an envelope that expresses longitudes in the range [-180 … +180]° is not compatible with an envelope that expresses
      longitudes in the range [0 … 360]°.
      The conversions, if necessary, are up to the user
      (the <code>Envelopes</code> class provides convenience methods to do this).
      Moreover, the envelope's coordinates must be included within the system of coordinates,
      unless the developer explicitly decides to consider (for example) 300° longitude as a position distinct from -60°.
      The <code>GeneralEnvelope</code> class provides a <code class="SIS">normalize()</code> method to bring
      coordinates within the desired limits, sometimes at the coast of <cite><i>lower</i></cite> values being higher than
      <cite><i>upper</i></cite> values.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <h5>The Special Case of the Range [+0 … -0]</h5>
      <p>
        Java (or more generally, IEEE Standard 754) defines two values distinct from zero:
        a positive zero and a negative zero. These two values are considered equal when we compare them with the <code>==</code> operator in Java.
        But in <abbr>SIS</abbr> envelopes, they may actually return opposite results for axes using <code>RangeMeaning.WRAPAROUND</code>.
        An envelope whose range is [0 … 0], [-0 … -0] or [-0 … +0] would normally be considered an empty envelope,
        but the [+0 … -0] range would in fact be considered to include the entire set of values all around the world.
        This behaviour conforms to the definition of <code class="SIS">lowerCorner</code> and <code class="SIS">upperCorner</code>,
        which considers +0 as the starting point, and -0 as the end-point after cycling through all possible values.
        Such behaviour only occurs for the pair of values +0 and -0, and only in that order.
        For all other real values, if the condition <code>lower</code> <code>==</code> <code>upper</code> is true,
        then it is guaranteed that the envelope is empty.
