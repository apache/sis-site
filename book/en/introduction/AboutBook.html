        Standards sometimes favour the application of certain generic terms to particular contexts,
        which may differ from the context in which other communities use these terms.
        For example, the terms <i>domain</i> and <i>range</i> may apply to arbitrary functions in order to designate
        a set of possible values of inputs and outputs respectively.
        But the functions to which they are applied by certain <abbr>ISO</abbr> standards are not the same as the functions to which they are applied by other libraries.
        For example, <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19123 applies these terms to <code>CV_Coverage</code> objects,
        seen as functions in which the <i>domain</i> is the set of spatio-temporal coordinates encompassed by the data,
        and the <i>range</i> is the set of values encompassed.
        But <abbr title="University Corporation for Atmospheric Research">UCAR</abbr>’s <abbr title="Network Common Data Form">NetCDF</abbr> library
        applies these terms instead to the function of converting pixel indices (its <i>domain</i>) to spatial-temporal coordinates (its <i>range</i>).
        Thus the <abbr>UCAR</abbr> library’s <i>range</i> may be the <i>domain</i> of <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19123.
      </p><p>
        The Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> library prefers as much as possible to use terms in the sense of <abbr>OGC</abbr> and <abbr>ISO</abbr> norms.
        Particular care must be taken, however, with the interfaces between <abbr>SIS</abbr> and certain other external libraries,
        in order to reduce the risk of confusion.

        The elements defined in a computer language, such as classes and methods in Java or elements in an <abbr>XML</abbr> document,
        appear in monospaced font.
        In order to facilitate an understanding of the relationships between Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> and the standards, these elements are also represented using the following colour codes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Elements defined in the <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> standard
          or the <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> standard appear in blue.
          Example: <code>CD_Ellipsoid</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Elements defined in GeoAPI appear in green.
          Example: <code>Ellipsoid</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Elements defined in Apache <abbr title="Spatial Information System">SIS</abbr> appear in brown.
          Example: <code>DefaultEllipsoid</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other elements, such as those in standard Java, are left in black.
          Example: <code>String</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
