        <h2 id="GeoAPI">From conceptual models to Java interfaces: GeoAPI</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        The <a href="http://www.geoapi.org">GeoAPI</a> project offers a set of Java interfaces for geospatial applications.
        In a series of <code>org.opengis.*</code> packages, GeoAPI defines structures representing metadata,
        coordinate reference systems and operations that perform cartographic projections.
        In a part that is not yet standardized — called <i>pending</i> — GeoAPI defines structures that represent geo-referenced images,
        geometries, filters that can be applied to queries, and other features.
        These interfaces closely follow the specifications of the <abbr>OGC</abbr>, while interpreting and adapting them
        to meet the needs of Java developers — for example, conforming with naming conventions.
        These interfaces benefit both client applications and libraries:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          Developers of client applications benefit from the greater knowledge base available on the Internet
          (due to the many publications related to <abbr>OGC</abbr> standards), as well as increased interoperability.
          Interoperability is facilitated by a better separation between applications that <em>call</em> GeoAPI functions,
          and libraries that <em>implement</em> GeoAPI.
          The separation is similar to that offered by the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/"><abbr>JDBC</abbr></a> (<i>Java Database Connectivity</i>) interfaces of standard Java.
          Using the interfaces’ <abbr>API</abbr>, developers can ignore the underlying implementation.
          For example, they can perform cartographic projections with the help of the <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/geoapi-proj4/index.html">Proj.4</a> library, or the Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> library,
          without having to change their programs when they change libraries.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          The developers of libraries inherit the expertise of the specifications’ authors, via the models that represent interfaces.
          GeoAPI also provides a framework within which developers can prioritize the implementation of the features they most need,
          while leaving the remaining features as extension points for future developments.
          For example, clients can call a GeoAPI function even if it is not yet supported by the library,
          and simply get a null value until a new version of the library returns a relevant value.
        </p></li>
      </ul>

            <h2>GeoAPI project history</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            In 2001, the Open GIS Consortium (the former name of the Open Geospatial Consortium) published
            <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/ct"><abbr>OGC</abbr> implementation specification 01-009:
            <cite>Coordinate Transformation Services</cite></a>.
            This specification, developed by the Computer Aided Development Corporation (Cadcorp),
            was accompanied by <abbr>COM</abbr>, <abbr>CORBA</abbr>, and Java interfaces.
            At this time, the wave of web services had not yet eclipsed classical programming interfaces.
            The interfaces of the <abbr>OGC</abbr> did anticipate a networked world,
            but invested rather — in the case of Java — in <abbr>RMI</abbr> (<i>Remote Method Invocation</i>) technology.
            As the GeoAPI project did not yet exist, we retroactively designate these historical interfaces “<a href="http://www.geoapi.org/0.1/index.html">GeoAPI 0.1</a>”.
            These interfaces already used the package name <code>org.opengis</code>, which would be adopted by GeoAPI.
          </p><p>
            In 2002, developers of free projects launched a
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030509104308/http://digitalearth.org/story/2002/10/10/55046/206">call for the creation of a geospatial <abbr>API</abbr></a>.
            The initial proposal attracted the interest of at least five free projects.
            The project was created using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/geoapi/">SourceForge</a>,
            which has since hosted the source code in a <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/source-repository.html">Subversion repository</a>.
            It was then that the project assumed the name “GeoAPI”, and used the interfaces of the <abbr>OGC</abbr> specification 01-009 as a starting point.
          </p><p>
            A few months later, the <abbr>OGC</abbr> launched the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/go"><abbr>GO</abbr>-1: <i>Geographic Objects</i></a> project,
            which pursued goals similar to those of GeoAPI.
            In the meantime, the <abbr>OGC</abbr> abandonned some of their specifications in favor of <abbr>ISO</abbr> standards.
            GeoAPI and <abbr>GO-1</abbr> worked jointly to rework the GeoAPI interfaces and base them on the new <abbr>ISO</abbr> norms.
            Their first interation, <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/1.0/index.html">GeoAPI 1.0</a>,
            served as a starting point for the first draft of the <abbr>OGC</abbr> specification 03-064 by the <abbr>GO</abbr>-1 working group.
            The final version of this specification became an <abbr>OGC</abbr> standard in 2005,
            and <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/2.0/index.html">GeoAPI 2.0</a> was published at that time.
          </p><p>
            The <abbr>GO</abbr>-1 project was largely supported by a company called <i>Polexis</i>.
            Its acquisition by <i>Sys Technology</i>, and the change in priorities under the new owners,
            brought a halt to the <abbr>GO</abbr>-1 project, which in turn slowed development on GeoAPI.
            In order to resume development, a new working group entitled “GeoAPI 3.0” was created at the <abbr>OGC</abbr>.
            This group took a narrower focus compared to GeoAPI 2.0, concentrating on the most stable interfaces, and putting the others
            — such as geometries — in a module entitled “<a href="http://www.geoapi.org/geoapi-pending/index.html">pending</a>”, for future consideration.
            <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/3.0/index.html">GeoAPI 3.0</a> became an <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geoapi"><abbr>OGC</abbr> standard</a> in 2011.
            This version was the first to be deployed in the <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|geoapi">Maven central repository</a>.

      <p id="GeoAPI-core">
        GeoAPI is composed of many modules.
        The <code>geoapi</code> and <code>geoapi-pending</code> modules
        provide interfaces derived from <abbr>UML</abbr> schemas of international standards.
        The conceptual model will be explained in detail in the chapters describing Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> implementation.
        However, we can get an overview of its content by consulting the page listing the mapping between
        <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/3.0/javadoc/content.html">GeoAPI methods and the standards where they come from</a>.
        Those modules and the mapping between GeoAPI and international standards are described in more details <a href="#SpecificationToInterfaces">in annex</a>.
      </p>



      <h3 id="GeoAPI-implementation">Implementations provided by Apache SIS</h3>
      <p>
        Apache SIS implements most GeoAPI interfaces by a class of the same name than the interface
        but prefixed by “<code>Abstract</code>”, “<code>Default</code>” or “<code>General</code>”.
        Apache SIS classes prefixed by “<code>Default</code>” can be instantiated directly by a
        <code>new DefaultXXX(…)</code> statement or by a call to the <code>createXXX(…)</code> method in a factory.
      </p>
      <div class="example"><b>Example:</b> to represent a projected coordinate reference system (Mercator, Lambert, <i>etc</i>):
        <ul>
          <li><code>org.opengis.referencing.crs.ProjectedCRS</code> is the GeoAPI interface derived from ISO 19111 standard, and</li>
          <li><code>org.apache.sis.referencing.crs.DefaultProjectedCRS</code> is the implementation provided by Apache SIS.</li>
        </ul>
        An instance can be created by:
        <ul>
          <li><code>ProjectedCRS crs = new DefaultProjectedCRS(…)</code>, ou</li>
          <li><code>ProjectedCRS crs = CRSFactory.createProjectedCRS(…)</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        Both approaches expect the same arguments (omitted in this example for brevity).
      </div>
      <p>
        In the default Apache SIS configuration, using <code>CRSFactory.createXXX(…)</code> or <code>new DefaultXXX(…)</code>
        is almost the same except that <code>Factory</code> may return existing instances instead than creating new instances,
        and that exceptions thrown in case of invalid arguments are different types.
        In more advanced configurations, using <code>Factory</code> reduces the
        <a href="#ServiceLoader">direct dependencies toward Apache SIS</a>
        and allows inversion of control.
      </p><p>
        The “<code>General</code>” prefix is sometime used instead than “<code>Default</code>”
        to indicate that alternative implementations are available for some specific cases.
        For example the <code>Envelope</code> interface is implemented by at least two Apache SIS classes:
        <code>GeneralEnvelope</code> and <code>Envelope2D</code>.
        The first implementation can represent envelopes with any number of dimensions
        while the second implementation is specialized for two-dimensional envelopes.
      </p><p>
        Apache SIS classes prefixed by “<code>Abstract</code>” should not – in principle – be instantiated.
        Users should instantiate a non-abstract subclass instead.
        But many SIS classes are only conceptually abstract, without <code>abstract</code> Java keyword in class definition.
        Such classes can be instantiated by a <code>new AbstractXXX(…)</code> statement
        – but not by <code>Factory</code> – despite being conceptually abstract.
        However such instantiations should be done only in last resort, when it is not possible to determine the exact subtype.
