        <h2 id="AffineTransform">Affine transform</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Among the many kinds of operations performed by <abbr>GIS</abbr> software products on spatial coordinates,
        <cite>affine transforms</cite>  are both relatively simple and very common.
        Affine transforms can represent any combination of scales, shears, flips, rotations and translations,
        which are <em>linear</em> operations.
        Affine transforms can not handle <em>non-linear</em> operations like map projections,
        but the affine transform capabilities nevertheless cover many other cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Axis order changes,           for example from (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>) to (<var>longitude</var>, <var>latitude</var>).</li>
        <li>Axis direction changes,       for example the <var>y</var> axis oriented toward down in images.</li>
        <li>Prime meridian rotations,     for example from <cite>Paris</cite> to <cite>Greenwich</cite> prime meridian.</li>
        <li>Dimensionality changes,       for example from 3-dimensional coordinates to 2-dimensional coordinates by dropping the height.</li>
        <li>Unit conversion,              for example from feet to metres.</li>
        <li>Pixel to geodetic coordinate, for example the conversion represented in the <code>.tfw</code> files associated to some <abbr>TIFF</abbr> images.</li>
        <li>Part of map projections,      for example the <cite>False Easting</cite>, <cite>False Northing</cite> and <cite>Scale factor</cite> parameters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Affine transforms can be concatenated efficiently.
        No matter how many affine transforms are chained, the result can be represented by a single affine transform.
        This property is more easily seen when affine transforms are represented by matrices:
        in order to concatenate those operations, we only need to multiply those matrices.
        The “pixel to geographic coordinate conversions” case below gives an example.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <p><b>Example:</b>
          given an image with pixel coordinates represented by (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) tuples
          and given the following assumptions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is no shear, no rotation and no flip.</li>
          <li>All pixels have the same width in degrees of longitude.</li>
          <li>All pixels have the same height in degrees of latitude.</li>
          <li>Pixel indices are positive integers starting at (0,0) inclusive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then conversions from pixel coordinates (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>)
          to geographic coordinates (<var>λ</var>,<var>φ</var>) can be represented by the following equations,
          where <var>N</var><sub><var>x</var></sub> is the image width and
          <var>N</var><sub><var>y</var></sub> the image height in number of pixels:
        </p><p>
          <xi:include href="../../../math/PixelToGeographicTerms.html"/>
        </p><p>
          Above equations can be represented in matrix form as below:
        </p><p>
        <xi:include href="../../../math/PixelToGeographic.html"/>
        </p><p>
          In this particular case, scale factors <var>S</var> are the pixel size in degrees
          and translation terms <var>T</var> are the geographic coordinate of an image corner
          (not necessarily the lower-left corner if some axes have been flipped).
          This straightforward interpretation holds because of above-cited assumptions, but
          matrix coefficients become more complex if the image has shear or rotation
          or if pixel coordinates do not start at (0,0).
          However it is not necessary to use more complex equations for supporting more generic cases.
          The following example starts with an “initial conversion” matrix
          where the <var>S</var> and <var>T</var> terms are set to the most straightforward values.
          Then the <var>y</var> axis direction is reversed for matching the most common convention in image coordinate systems (change 1),
          and axis are swapped resulting in latitude before longitude (change 2).
          Note that when affine transform concatenations are written as matrix multiplications, operations are ordered from right to left:
          <var>A</var>×<var>B</var>×<var>C</var> is equivalent to first applying operation <var>C</var>,
          then operation <var>B</var> and finally operation <var>A</var>.

          A key principle is that there is no need to write Java code dedicated to above kinds of axis changes.
          Those operations, and many other, can be handled by matrix algebra.
          This approach makes easier to write generic code and improves performance.
          Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> follows this principle by using affine transforms for every operations
          that can be performed by such transform.
          For instance there is no code dedicated to changing order of ordinate values in a coordinate.

      <h3 id="AffineTransformAPI">Integration with graphical libraries</h3>
      <p>
        About all graphical libraries support some kind of coordinate operations, usually as <cite>affine transforms</cite>
        or a slight generalization like <cite>perspective transforms</cite>.
        Each library defines its own <abbr>API</abbr>. Some examples are listed below:
      </p>
      <table>
        <caption>Affine transform implementations in graphical libraries</caption>
        <tr><th>Library</th>                                  <th>Transform implementation</th>                          <th>Dimensions</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Java2D</td>                                   <td><code>java.awt.geom.AffineTransform</code></td>        <td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Java3D</td>                                   <td><code>javax.media.j3d.Transform3D</code></td>          <td>3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>JavaFX</td>                                   <td><code>javafx.scene.transform.Affine</code></td>        <td>2 or 3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Java Advanced Imaging (<abbr>JAI</abbr>)</td> <td><code>javax.media.jai.PerspectiveTransform</code></td> <td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Android</td>                                  <td><code>android.graphics.Matrix</code></td>              <td>2</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        However in many cases, affine or perspective transforms are the only kind of coordinate operations supported by the graphical library.
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> needs to handle a wider range of operations, in which affine transforms are only special cases.
        In particular most map projections and datum shifts can not be represented by affine transforms.
        <abbr>SIS</abbr> also needs to support arbitrary number of dimensions,
        while above-cited <abbr>API</abbr> restrict the use to a fixed number of dimensions.
        For those reasons <abbr>SIS</abbr> can not use directly the above-cited <abbr>API</abbr>.
        Instead, <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses the more abstract <code>org.opengis.referencing.transform.MathTransform</code> interface.
        But in the special case where the transform is actually affine, <abbr>SIS</abbr> may try to use an existing implementation,
        in particular Java2D. The following Java code can be used in situations where the Java2D object is desired:
      </p>

<pre><code>MathTransform mt = ...;    // Any math transform created by Apache SIS.
if (mt instanceof AffineTransform) {
    AffineTransform at = (AffineTransform) mt;
    // Use Java2D API from here.
}</code></pre>

      <p>
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses Java2D on a <em>best effort</em> basis only.
        The above cast is not guaranteed to succeed,
        even when the <code>MathTransform</code> meets the requirements allowing Java2D usage.
