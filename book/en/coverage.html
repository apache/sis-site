    </header>
    <p>
      Images, or <i>rasters</i>, are a particular case of a data structure called a <i>coverage</i>.
      We could think of this as a “coverage of data.”
      The title of the <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19123 standard that describes them, “Coverage Geometry and Functions”,
      nicely summarizes the two essential elements of coverages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A coverage is a function which returns an attribute value from an entered coordinate.
          The set of values that may be entered is called the domain, while the set of values that may be returned is called the range.
          The domain is often the spatio-temporal area covered by the data,
          but nothing in <abbr>SIS</abbr> prevents coverages from extending to other dimensions.
          For example, thermodynamic studies often use an area where the dimensions are temperature and pressure.
        </p>
        <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
          The pixel values of an image may contain measures for terrain elevation.
          If the function <var>h</var> = <var>f</var>(φ,λ) allows us to obtain (eventually, with the help of interpolations)
          the elevation <var>h</var> according the the geographic coordinate (φ,λ),
          then the geographic envelope of the image defined by the domain — the function <var>f</var> — is the <i>coverage</i>,
          and the set of values <var>h</var> that this function can return is the <i>range</i>.
        </p></div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Different types of coverages may be characterized by the geometry of their cells.
          In particular, a coverage is not necessarily composed of quadrilateral cells.
          However, given that quadrilateral cells are by far the most frequent (since this is the usual geometry of image pixels),
          we often use the term “grid coverage” to specify coverages composed of such cells.
          In <abbr>SIS</abbr>, the geometry of coverages is described by the <code>GridGeometry</code> class.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The characteristics of the spatial domain are defined by <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19123 standard,
      while the characteristics of range are not included in the standard.
      The standard simply mentions that ranges may be finite or infinite,
      and are not necessarily numerical.
      For example, the values returned by a coverage may come from an enumeration (“this is a forest,” “this is a lake,” etc.).
      However, the standard defines two important types of coverage which have an impact on the types of authorized ranges:
      <i>discrete</i> coverages and <i>continuous</i> coverages.
      Stated simply, continuous coverages are functions that can use interpolation methods.
      Thus, since interpolations are only possible with numeric values, the ranges of non-numeric values may only be used with coverages of the
      <code>CV_DiscreteCoverage</code> type.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <h2>SIS's <code>Range</code> class and its relationship to the standards</h2>
      <p>
        The distinction between the ranges of all types of values and the ranges of numeric values is represented in
        <abbr>SIS</abbr> by the <code>Range</code> and <code>NumberRange</code>
        classes respectively.
        The <code>NumberRange</code> is used more often, and is also the one that most closely approaches the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28mathematics%29">the common mathematical concept of an interval</a>.
        This textual representation approaches the specifications of <abbr>ISO</abbr> 31-11 standard,
        except that the comma is replaced by the character “…” as the separator of minimal and maximal values.
        For example, “[0 … 256)” represents the range of values from 0 inclusive to 256 exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>Range</code> objects are only indirectly associated with coverages.
        In <abbr>SIS</abbr>, the values that can return coverages are described by objects of the
        <code class="SIS">SampleDimension</code> type. It is these that contain instances of <code>Range</code>,
        as well as other information such as <i>transfer function</i> (described later).
