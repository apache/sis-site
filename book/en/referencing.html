      For locating a point on Earth one can use identifiers like city name or postal address
      — an approach known as <cite>spatial reference systems by identifiers</cite> —
      or use numerical values valid in a given coordinate system
      — an approach known as <cite>spatial reference systems by coordinates</cite>.
      Each system implies approximations as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choice of a figure of the Earth (geoid, ellipsoid, <i>etc.</i>) used as an approximation of Earth shape.</li>
      <li>Choice of geometric properties (angles, distances, <i>etc.</i>) to be preserved when a map is shown on plane surface.</li>
      <li>Lost of precision when a coordinates is transformed from one referencing system to another system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise specified, Apache SIS aims to represent coordinates on Earth with an accuracy of one centimetre or better.
      But the accuracy can be altered by various situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Points should be inside the domain of validity as given by <code>ReferenceSystem.getDomainOfValidity()</code>.</li>
      <li>Distance measurements in a given map projection are true only is some special locations,
          named for instance “standards parallels”.</li>
      <li>Positional accuracy is reduced after coordinate transformations. The new accuracy is described by
          <code>CoordinateOperation.getCoordinateOperationAccuracy()</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <code>sis-referencing</code> module provides a set of classes implementing
      different specializations of the <code>ReferenceSystem</code> interface, together with required components.
      Those implementations store spatial reference system descriptions, together with metadata like their domain of validity.
      However those objects do not perform any operation on coordinate values.
      Those operations are performed by another family of types, with <code>CoordinateOperation</code> as the root interface.
      Those types will be discussed in <a href="#CoordinateOperation">another section</a>,
      but we mention here two sub-types related to the coordinate accuracy topic:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Coordinate <strong>conversions</strong> are fully determined by mathematic formulas.
        Those conversions would have an infinite precision if it was not for the unavoidable rounding errors
        inherent to floating-point calculations.</p>
        <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b> map projections.</p></div>
      </li><li>
        <p>Coordinate <strong>transformations</strong> are defined empirically.
        They usually have a few meters error which is not caused by limitation in computer accuracy.
        Those errors exist because transformations are only approximations of a more complex reality.</p>

        <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b> datum changes from
        <cite>North American Datum 1927</cite> (<abbr>NAD27</abbr>) to
        <cite>North American Datum 1983</cite> (<abbr>NAD83</abbr>),
        even if the map projection method (e.g. Lambert Conformal or Transverse Mercator) does not change.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>



    <h2 id="CRS_Components">Components of a reference system by coordinates</h2>
    <p>
      Spatial reference systems by coordinates provide necessary information for mapping numerical coordinate values
      to real-world locations. In Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>, most information is contained (directly or indirectly) in
      classes with a name ending in <abbr>CRS</abbr>, the abbreviation of <i>Coordinate Reference System</i>.
      Those objects contain:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <i>datum</i>, which specifies among other things which ellipsoid to use as an Earth shape approximation.</li>
      <li>A description for each axis: name, direction, units of measurement, range of values.</li>
      <li>Sometime a list of parameters. A well-known example is when the <abbr>CRS</abbr> uses a map projection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Those systems are described by the <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19111 standard (<i>Referencing by Coordinates</i>),
      which replaces for most parts the older <abbr>OGC 01-009</abbr> standard (<i>Coordinate Transformation Services</i>).
      Those standards are completed by two other standards defining exchange formats:
      <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19136 and 19162 respectively for the
      <cite>Geographic Markup Language</cite> (<abbr>GML</abbr>) — a <abbr>XML</abbr> format which is quite detailed but verbose —
      and the <cite>Well-Known Text</cite> (<abbr>WKT</abbr>) — a text format easier to read by humans.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Ellipsoid">Geoid et ellipsoid</h3>
    <p>
      Since the real topographic surface is difficult to represent mathematically, it is not used directly.
      A slightly more convenient surface is the geoid,
      a surface where the gravitational field has the same value everywhere (an equipotential surface).
      This surface is perpendicular to the direction of a plumb line at all points.
      The geoid surface would be equivalent to the mean sea level if all oceans where at rest,
      without winds or permanent currents like the Gulf Stream.
    </p><p>
      While much smoother than topographic surface, the geoid surface still have hollows and bumps
      caused by the uneven distribution of mass inside Earth.
      For more convenient mathematical operations, the geoid surface is approximated by an ellipsoid.
      This “figure of Earth” is represented in GeoAPI by the <code>Ellipsoid</code> interface,
      a fundamental component in coordinate reference systems of kind <code>GeographicCRS</code> and <code>ProjectedCRS</code>.
      Tenth of ellipsoids are commonly used for datum definitions.
      Some of them provide a very good approximation for a particular geographic area
      at the expense of the rest of the world for which the datum was not designed.
      Other datums are compromises applicable to the whole world.
    </p>
    <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
      At the beginning of XX<sup>th</sup> century in <abbr>USA</abbr>, the Michigan state used an ellipsoid based on the
      “Clarke 1866” ellipsoid but with axis lengths expanded by 800 feet.
      This modification aimed to take in account the average state height above mean sea level.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="GeodeticDatum">Geodetic datum</h3>
    <p>
      For defining a geodetic system in a country, a national authority selects an ellipsoid matching closely the country surface.
      Differences between that ellipsoid and the geoid’s hollows and bumps are usually less than 100 metres.
      Parameters that relate an <code>Ellipsoid</code> to the Earth surface (for example the position of ellipsoid center)
      are represented by instances of <code>GeodeticDatum</code>.
      Many <code>GeodeticDatum</code> definitions can use the same <code>Ellipsoid</code>,
      but with different orientations or center positions.
    </p><p>
      Before the satellite era, geodetic measurements were performed exclusively from Earth surface.
      Consequently, two islands or continents not in range of sight from each other were not geodetically related.
      So the <cite>North American Datum 1983</cite> (<abbr>NAD83</abbr>) and the <cite>European Datum 1950</cite> (<abbr>ED50</abbr>)
      are independent: their ellipsoids have different sizes and are centered at a different positions.
      The same geographic coordinate will map different locations on Earth depending on whether the coordinate
      uses one reference system or the other.
    </p><p>
      The <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> invention implied the creation of a
      world geodetic system named <abbr title="World Geodetic System 1984">WGS84</abbr>.
      The ellipsoid is then unique and centered at the Earth gravity center.
      <abbr>GPS</abbr> provide at any moment the receptor absolute position on that world geodetic system.
      But since <abbr>WGS84</abbr> is a world-wide system, it may be differ significantly from local systems.
      For example the difference between <abbr>WGS84</abbr> and the European system <abbr>ED50</abbr> is about 150 metres,
      and the average difference between <abbr>WGS84</abbr> and the <cite>Réunion 1947</cite> system is 1.5 kilometres.
      Consequently we shall not blindly use <abbr>GPS</abbr> coordinates on a map,
      as transformations to the local system may be required.
      Those transformations are represented in GeoAPI by instances of the <code>Transformation</code> interface
      (a kind of operation mentioned in <a href="#Referencing">this chapter introduction</a>).
    </p><p>
      The <abbr>WGS84</abbr> ubiquity tends to reduce the need for <code>Transformation</code> operations with recent data,
      but does not eliminate it.
      The Earth moves under the effect of plate tectonic and new systems are defined every years for taking that fact in account.
      For example while <abbr>NAD83</abbr> was originally defined as practically equivalent to <abbr>WGS84</abbr>,
      there is now (as of 2016) a 1.5 metres difference.
      The <cite>Japanese Geodetic Datum 2000</cite> was also defined as practically equivalent to <abbr>WGS84</abbr>,
      but the <cite>Japanese Geodetic Datum 2011</cite> now differs.
      Even the <abbr>WGS84</abbr> datum, which was a terrestrial model realization at a specific time,
      got revisions because of improvements in instruments accuracy.
      Today, at least six <abbr>WGS84</abbr> versions exist.
      Furthermore many borders were legally defined in legacy datums, for example <abbr>NAD27</abbr> in <abbr>USA</abbr>.
      Updating data to the new datum would imply transforming some straight lines or simple geometric shapes
      into more irregular shapes, if the shapes are large enough.

        <h1>“Early binding” versus “late binding” implementations</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        Because of the <abbr>WGS84</abbr> ubiquity, it is tempting to use that system as a hub or a pivot system
        for all coordinate transformations.
        The use of an “universal” system as a pivot simplifies the design of coordinate transformations libraries.
        For example transformations from datum <var>A</var> to datum <var>B</var> can be done by first transforming
        from <var>A</var> to <abbr>WGS84</abbr>, then from <abbr>WGS84</abbr> to <var>B</var>.
        With such approach, a coordinate transformations library would only need to associate each
        <code>GeodeticDatum</code> instance with the transformation parameters from that datum to <abbr>WGS84</abbr>.
        This approach was encouraged in version 1 of <abbr>WKT</abbr> format, since that format specified a
        <code>TOWGS84[…]</code> element (removed in <abbr>WKT</abbr> version 2) precisely for that purpose.
        This approach is known in <abbr>EPSG</abbr> guidance notes as “early binding” implementations
        since information about coordinate transformations are associated early in geodetic object definitions,
        usually right at <code>GeographicCRS</code> creation time.
        While <abbr>EPSG</abbr> acknowledges that this approach is commonly used,
        this is not a recommended strategy for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>More than one transformation may exist from datum <var>A</var> to datum <var>B</var>,
            where each transformation is designed for a different geographic area.</li>
        <li>Some operations are designed specifically for transformations from <var>A</var> to <var>B</var>
            and do not have the same accuracy than an operation using <abbr>WGS84</abbr> as an intermediate step.</li>
        <li><abbr>WGS84</abbr> itself has been updated many times,
            which makes it a kind of moving target (admittedly slowly) for coordinate transformations libraries.</li>
        <li>Different systems could be used as the pivot system, for example the <cite>Galileo Reference Frame</cite>
            (<abbr>GTRF</abbr>) created for the European <abbr>GPS</abbr> competitor.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
        the <abbr>EPSG</abbr> geodetic dataset defines about 50 transformations from <abbr>NAD27</abbr> to <abbr>NAD83</abbr>.
        In an early binding approach, the same geographic <abbr>CRS</abbr> (namely “<abbr>NAD27</abbr>”) in the <abbr>WKT</abbr> 1
        format would need to be defined with a <code>TOWGS84[-8, 160, 176]</code> element for coordinates in <abbr>USA</abbr>
        or with a <code>TOWGS84[-10, 158, 187]</code> element for coordinates in Canada.
        Different parameter values exist for other regions like Cuba, so it is not possible to represent such diversity
        with a single <code>TOWGS84[…]</code> element associated to a <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
        But even when restricting <abbr>CRS</abbr> usage to the domain of validity of its single <code>TOWGS84[…]</code> element,
        those transformations are still approximative with a 10 metres accuracy in the <abbr>USA</abbr> case.
        More accurate transformations exist in the form of <abbr>NADCON</abbr> grid shift files,
        but those transformations are from <abbr>NAD27</abbr> to <abbr>NAD83</abbr> (which move together on the same continental plate),
        not to <abbr>WGS84</abbr> (which move independently).
        The difference was often ignored when <abbr>NAD83</abbr> and <abbr>WGS84</abbr> were considered as practically equivalent,
        but that assumption is subject to more caution today.
      </p></div>
      <p>
        <abbr>EPSG</abbr> rather recommends the use of “late binding” approach,
        in which coordinate transformation methods and parameters are defined for
        “<var>A</var> to <var>B</var>” pairs of systems (eventually completed with domain of validity)
        rather than associated to standalone datums.
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> is a “late binding” implementation,
        while some reminiscences of “early binding” approach still exist in the form of the
        <code>DefaultGeodeticDatum.getBursaWolfParameters()</code> property.
        The later is used only if <abbr>SIS</abbr> fails to apply the late binding approach for given reference systems.

    <h3 id="CoordinateSystem">Coordinate systems</h3>
    <p style="color: red">TODO</p>

    <h4 id="AxisOrder">Axis order</h4>
    <p>
      The axis order is specified by the authority (typically a national agency) defining the <cite>Coordinate Reference System</cite> (<abbr>CRS</abbr>).
      The order depends on the <abbr>CRS</abbr> type and the country defining the <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
      In the case of geographic <abbr>CRS</abbr>, the (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>) axis order is widely used by geographers and pilots for centuries.
      However software developers tend to consistently use the (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) order for every kind of <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
      Those different practices resulted in contradictory definitions of axis order for almost every <abbr>CRS</abbr> of kind <code>GeographicCRS</code>,
      for some <code>ProjectedCRS</code> in the South hemisphere (South Africa, Australia, <i>etc.</i>) and for some polar projections among others.
    </p><p>
      Recent <abbr>OGC</abbr> standards mandate the use of axis order as defined by the authority.
      Oldest <abbr>OGC</abbr> standards used the (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) axis order instead, ignoring any authority specification.
      Many softwares still use the old (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) axis order,
      maybe because such uniformization makes <abbr>CRS</abbr> implementation and usage <em>apparently</em> easier.
      Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> supports both conventions with the following approach:
      by default, <abbr>SIS</abbr> creates <abbr>CRS</abbr> with axis order <em>as defined by the authority</em>.
      Those <abbr>CRS</abbr> are created by calls to the <code>CRS.forCode(String)</code> method
      and the actual axis order can be verified after the <abbr>CRS</abbr> creation with <code>System.out.println(crs)</code>.
      But if (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) axis order is wanted for compatibility with older <abbr>OGC</abbr> specifications or other softwares,
      then <abbr>CRS</abbr> forced to <cite>longitude first</cite> axis order can be created by a call to the following method:
    </p>
    <pre>CoordinateReferenceSystem crs = …;               // CRS obtained by any means.
crs = AbstractCRS.castOrCopy(crs).forConvention(AxesConvention.RIGHT_HANDED)</pre>
    <p>
      Among the legacy <abbr>OGC</abbr> standards that used the non-conform axis order,
      an influent one is version 1 of the <cite>Well Known Text</cite> (<abbr>WKT</abbr>) format specification.
      According that widely-used format, <abbr>WKT</abbr> 1 definitions without explicit <code>AXIS[…]</code> elements
      shall default to (<var>longitude</var>, <var>latitude</var>) or (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) axis order.
      In version 2 of <abbr>WKT</abbr> format, <code>AXIS[…]</code> elements are no longer optional
      and should contain an explicit <code>ORDER[…]</code> sub-element for making the intended order yet more obvious.
      But if <code>AXIS[…]</code> elements are nevertheless missing in a <abbr>WKT</abbr> 2 definition,
      Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> defaults to (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>) order.
      So in summary:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Default <abbr>WKT</abbr> 1 axis order of geographic <abbr>CRS</abbr> is (<var>longitude</var>, <var>latitude</var>) as mandated by <abbr>OGC</abbr> 01-009 specification.</li>
      <li>Default <abbr>WKT</abbr> 2 axis order of geographic <abbr>CRS</abbr> is (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>),
          but this is <abbr>SIS</abbr>-specific as <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19162 does not mention default axis order.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To avoid ambiguities, users are encouraged to always provide explicit <code>AXIS[…]</code> elements in their <abbr>WKT</abbr>.
      The <abbr>WKT</abbr> format will be presented in more details in the next sections.

      The geometric properties to preserve depend on the feature to represent and the work to do on that feature.

    <h2 id="CoordinateOperation">Coordinate operations</h2>
    <p>
      Given a <em>source</em> coordinate reference system (<abbr>CRS</abbr>) in which existing coordinate values are expressed,
      and a <em>target</em> coordinate reference system in which coordinate values are desired,
      Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> can provide a <em>coordinate operation</em> performing the conversion or transformation work.
      The search for coordinate operations may use a third argument, optional but recommended,
      which is the geographic area of the data to transform.
      That later argument is recommended because coordinate operations are often valid only in a some geographic area
      (typically a particular country or state), and many transformations may exist
      for the same pair of source and target <abbr>CRS</abbr> but different domain of validity.
      Different coordinate operations may also be different compromises between accuracy and their domain of validity,
      and specifying a smaller area of interest may allow Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> to select a more accurate operation.
    </p>
    <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
      the <abbr>EPSG</abbr> geodetic dataset (as of version 7.9) defines 77 coordinate operations from the
      <cite>North American Datum 1927</cite> (EPSG:4267) coordinate reference system to the
      <cite>World Geodetic System 1984</cite> (EPSG:4326) <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
      There is one operation valid only for coordinate transformations in Québec,
      another operation valid for coordinate transformations in Texas west of 100°W,
      another operation for the same state but east of 100°W, <i>etc</i>.
      If the user did not specified any geographic area of interest,
      then Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> defaults on the coordinate operation which is valid in the largest area.
      In this example, the “largest area” criterion results in the selection of a coordinate operation valid for Canada,
      not <abbr>USA</abbr>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The easiest way to obtain a coordinate operation from above-cited information
      is to use the <code>org.apache.sis.referencing.CRS</code> convenience class:
    </p>
    <pre>CoordinateOperation cop = CRS.findOperation(sourceCRS, targetCRS, areaOfInterest);</pre>
    <p>
      Among the information provided by <code>CoordinateOperation</code> object, the following are of special interest:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <cite>domain of validity</cite>, either as a textual description (e.g. “Canada – onshore and offshore”)
          or with the coordinates of a geographic bounding box.</li>
      <li>The <cite>positional accuracy</cite>, which may be anything from 1 centimetre to a few kilometres.</li>
      <li>The coordinate operation subtype. If the coordinate operation is an instance of <code>Transformation</code>,
          then it may be one among many possibilities depending on the area of interest, and its accuracy is limited by
          “real world” constraints (not only rounding errors).
          If the coordinate operation is rather an instance of <code>Conversion</code>, then it does not have those limitations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The actual mathematical work is performed by an object obtained by a call to <code>cop.getMathTransform()</code>.
      The <code>CoordinateOperation</code> and <code>MathTransform</code> types are separated because the later is a kind of “black box”,
      which may be implemented in a very different way than what the coordinate operation said.
      In particular many conceptually different coordinate operations (e.g. longitude rotations,
      change of units of measurement, conversions between two Mercator projections on the same datum, <i>etc.</i>)
      are implemented by <code>MathTransform</code> as <a href="#AffineTransform">affine transforms</a> and concatenated for efficiency.
    </p>

    <h3 id="MathTransform">Executing an operation on coordinate values</h3>
    <p>
      The following Java code performs a map projection from geographic coordinates on the <cite>World Geodetic System 1984</cite> (<abbr>WGS84</abbr>) datum
      coordinates in the <cite>WGS 84 / UTM zone 33N</cite> coordinate reference system.
      In order to make the example a little bit simpler, this code uses predefined constants given by the <code>CommonCRS</code> convenience class.
      But more advanced applications will typically use <abbr>EPSG</abbr> codes instead.
      Note that all geographic coordinates below express latitude before longitude.
