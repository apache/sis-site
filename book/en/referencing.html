    <p>
      For locating a point on Earth one can use identifiers like city name or postal address
      — an approach known as <cite>spatial reference systems by identifiers</cite> —
      or use numerical values valid in a given coordinate system
      — an approach known as <cite>spatial reference systems by coordinates</cite>.
      Each system implies approximations as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choice of a figure of the Earth (geoid, ellipsoid, <i>etc.</i>) used as an approximation of Earth shape.</li>
      <li>Choice of geometric properties (angles, distances, <i>etc.</i>) to be preserved when a map is shown on plane surface.</li>
      <li>Lost of precision when a coordinates is transformed from one referencing system to another system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise specified, Apache SIS aims to represent coordinates on Earth with an accuracy of one centimetre or better.
      But the accuracy can be altered by various situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Points should be inside the domain of validity as given by <code>ReferenceSystem.getDomainOfValidity()</code>.</li>
      <li>Distance measurements in a given map projection are true only is some special locations,
          named for instance “standards parallels”.</li>
      <li>Positional accuracy is reduced after coordinate transformations. The new accuracy is described by
          <code>CoordinateOperation.getCoordinateOperationAccuracy()</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <code>sis-referencing</code> module provides a set of classes implementing
      different specializations of the <code>ReferenceSystem</code> interface, together with required components.
      Those implementations store spatial reference system descriptions, together with metadata like their domain of validity.
      However those objects do not perform any operation on coordinate values.
      Those operations are performed by another family of types, with <code>CoordinateOperation</code> as the root interface.
      Those types will be discussed in <a href="#CoordinateOperation">another section</a>,
      but we mention here two sub-types related to the coordinate accuracy topic:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Coordinate <strong>conversions</strong> are fully determined by mathematic formulas.
        Those conversions would have an infinite precision if it was not for the unavoidable rounding errors
        inherent to floating-point calculations.</p>
        <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b> map projections.</p></div>
      </li><li>
        <p>Coordinate <strong>transformations</strong> are defined empirically.
        They usually have a few meters error which is not caused by limitation in computer accuracy.
        Those errors exist because transformations are only approximations of a more complex reality.</p>

        <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b> datum changes from
        <cite>North American Datum 1927</cite> (<abbr>NAD27</abbr>) to
        <cite>North American Datum 1983</cite> (<abbr>NAD83</abbr>),
        even if the map projection method (e.g. Lambert Conformal or Transverse Mercator) does not change.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>



    <h2 id="CRS_Components">Components of a reference system by coordinates</h2>
    <p>
      Spatial reference systems by coordinates provide necessary information for mapping numerical coordinate values
      to real-world locations. In Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>, most information is contained (directly or indirectly) in
      classes with a name ending in <abbr>CRS</abbr>, the abbreviation of <i>Coordinate Reference System</i>.
      Those objects contain:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <i>datum</i>, which specifies among other things which ellipsoid to use as an Earth shape approximation.</li>
      <li>A description for each axis: name, direction, units of measurement, range of values.</li>
      <li>Sometime a list of parameters. A well-known example is when the <abbr>CRS</abbr> uses a map projection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Those systems are described by the <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19111 standard (<i>Referencing by Coordinates</i>),
      which replaces for most parts the older <abbr>OGC 01-009</abbr> standard (<i>Coordinate Transformation Services</i>).
      Those standards are completed by two other standards defining exchange formats:
      <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19136 and 19162 respectively for the
      <cite>Geographic Markup Language</cite> (<abbr>GML</abbr>) — a <abbr>XML</abbr> format which is quite detailed but verbose —
      and the <cite>Well-Known Text</cite> (<abbr>WKT</abbr>) — a text format easier to read by humans.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Ellipsoid">Geoid et ellipsoid</h3>
    <p>
      Since the real topographic surface is difficult to represent mathematically, it is not used directly.
      A slightly more convenient surface is the geoid,
      a surface where the gravitational field has the same value everywhere (an equipotential surface).
      This surface is perpendicular to the direction of a plumb line at all points.
      The geoid surface would be equivalent to the mean sea level if all oceans where at rest,
      without winds or permanent currents like the Gulf Stream.
    </p><p>
      While much smoother than topographic surface, the geoid surface still have hollows and bumps
      caused by the uneven distribution of mass inside Earth.
      For more convenient mathematical operations, the geoid surface is approximated by an ellipsoid.
      This “figure of Earth” is represented in GeoAPI by the <code>Ellipsoid</code> interface,
      a fundamental component in coordinate reference systems of kind <code>GeographicCRS</code> and <code>ProjectedCRS</code>.
      Tenth of ellipsoids are commonly used for datum definitions.
      Some of them provide a very good approximation for a particular geographic area
      at the expense of the rest of the world for which the datum was not designed.
      Other datums are compromises applicable to the whole world.
    </p>
    <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
      At the beginning of XX<sup>th</sup> century in <abbr>USA</abbr>, the Michigan state used an ellipsoid based on the
      “Clarke 1866” ellipsoid but with axis lengths expanded by 800 feet.
      This modification aimed to take in account the average state height above mean sea level.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="GeodeticDatum">Geodetic datum</h3>
    <p>
      For defining a geodetic system in a country, a national authority selects an ellipsoid matching closely the country surface.
      Differences between that ellipsoid and the geoid’s hollows and bumps are usually less than 100 metres.
      Parameters that relate an <code>Ellipsoid</code> to the Earth surface (for example the position of ellipsoid center)
      are represented by instances of <code>GeodeticDatum</code>.
      Many <code>GeodeticDatum</code> definitions can use the same <code>Ellipsoid</code>,
      but with different orientations or center positions.
    </p><p>
      Before the satellite era, geodetic measurements were performed exclusively from Earth surface.
      Consequently, two islands or continents not in range of sight from each other were not geodetically related.
      So the <cite>North American Datum 1983</cite> (<abbr>NAD83</abbr>) and the <cite>European Datum 1950</cite> (<abbr>ED50</abbr>)
      are independent: their ellipsoids have different sizes and are centered at a different positions.
      The same geographic coordinate will map different locations on Earth depending on whether the coordinate
      uses one reference system or the other.
    </p><p>
      The <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> invention implied the creation of a
      world geodetic system named <abbr title="World Geodetic System 1984">WGS84</abbr>.
      The ellipsoid is then unique and centered at the Earth gravity center.
      <abbr>GPS</abbr> provide at any moment the receptor absolute position on that world geodetic system.
      But since <abbr>WGS84</abbr> is a world-wide system, it may be differ significantly from local systems.
      For example the difference between <abbr>WGS84</abbr> and the European system <abbr>ED50</abbr> is about 150 metres,
      and the average difference between <abbr>WGS84</abbr> and the <cite>Réunion 1947</cite> system is 1.5 kilometres.
      Consequently we shall not blindly use <abbr>GPS</abbr> coordinates on a map,
      as transformations to the local system may be required.
      Those transformations are represented in GeoAPI by instances of the <code>Transformation</code> interface
      (a kind of operation mentioned in <a href="#Referencing">this chapter introduction</a>).
    </p><p>
      The <abbr>WGS84</abbr> ubiquity tends to reduce the need for <code>Transformation</code> operations with recent data,
      but does not eliminate it.
      The Earth moves under the effect of plate tectonic and new systems are defined every years for taking that fact in account.
      For example while <abbr>NAD83</abbr> was originally defined as practically equivalent to <abbr>WGS84</abbr>,
      there is now (as of 2016) a 1.5 metres difference.
      The <cite>Japanese Geodetic Datum 2000</cite> was also defined as practically equivalent to <abbr>WGS84</abbr>,
      but the <cite>Japanese Geodetic Datum 2011</cite> now differs.
      Even the <abbr>WGS84</abbr> datum, which was a terrestrial model realization at a specific time,
      got revisions because of improvements in instruments accuracy.
      Today, at least six <abbr>WGS84</abbr> versions exist.
      Furthermore many borders were legally defined in legacy datums, for example <abbr>NAD27</abbr> in <abbr>USA</abbr>.
      Updating data to the new datum would imply transforming some straight lines or simple geometric shapes
      into more irregular shapes, if the shapes are large enough.

        <h1>“Early binding” versus “late binding” implementations</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        Because of the <abbr>WGS84</abbr> ubiquity, it is tempting to use that system as a hub or a pivot system
        for all coordinate transformations.
        The use of an “universal” system as a pivot simplifies the design of coordinate transformations libraries.
        For example transformations from datum <var>A</var> to datum <var>B</var> can be done by first transforming
        from <var>A</var> to <abbr>WGS84</abbr>, then from <abbr>WGS84</abbr> to <var>B</var>.
        With such approach, a coordinate transformations library would only need to associate each
        <code>GeodeticDatum</code> instance with the transformation parameters from that datum to <abbr>WGS84</abbr>.
        This approach was encouraged in version 1 of <abbr>WKT</abbr> format, since that format specified a
        <code>TOWGS84[…]</code> element (removed in <abbr>WKT</abbr> version 2) precisely for that purpose.
        This approach is known in <abbr>EPSG</abbr> guidance notes as “early binding” implementations
        since information about coordinate transformations are associated early in geodetic object definitions,
        usually right at <code>GeographicCRS</code> creation time.
        While <abbr>EPSG</abbr> acknowledges that this approach is commonly used,
        this is not a recommended strategy for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>More than one transformation may exist from datum <var>A</var> to datum <var>B</var>,
            where each transformation is designed for a different geographic area.</li>
        <li>Some operations are designed specifically for transformations from <var>A</var> to <var>B</var>
            and do not have the same accuracy than an operation using <abbr>WGS84</abbr> as an intermediate step.</li>
        <li><abbr>WGS84</abbr> itself has been updated many times,
            which makes it a kind of moving target (admittedly slowly) for coordinate transformations libraries.</li>
        <li>Different systems could be used as the pivot system, for example the <cite>Galileo Reference Frame</cite>
            (<abbr>GTRF</abbr>) created for the European <abbr>GPS</abbr> competitor.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
        the <abbr>EPSG</abbr> geodetic dataset defines about 50 transformations from <abbr>NAD27</abbr> to <abbr>NAD83</abbr>.
        In an early binding approach, the same geographic <abbr>CRS</abbr> (namely “<abbr>NAD27</abbr>”) in the <abbr>WKT</abbr> 1
        format would need to be defined with a <code>TOWGS84[-8, 160, 176]</code> element for coordinates in <abbr>USA</abbr>
        or with a <code>TOWGS84[-10, 158, 187]</code> element for coordinates in Canada.
        Different parameter values exist for other regions like Cuba, so it is not possible to represent such diversity
        with a single <code>TOWGS84[…]</code> element associated to a <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
        But even when restricting <abbr>CRS</abbr> usage to the domain of validity of its single <code>TOWGS84[…]</code> element,
        those transformations are still approximative with a 10 metres accuracy in the <abbr>USA</abbr> case.
        More accurate transformations exist in the form of <abbr>NADCON</abbr> grid shift files,
        but those transformations are from <abbr>NAD27</abbr> to <abbr>NAD83</abbr> (which move together on the same continental plate),
        not to <abbr>WGS84</abbr> (which move independently).
        The difference was often ignored when <abbr>NAD83</abbr> and <abbr>WGS84</abbr> were considered as practically equivalent,
        but that assumption is subject to more caution today.
      </p></div>
      <p>
        <abbr>EPSG</abbr> rather recommends the use of “late binding” approach,
        in which coordinate transformation methods and parameters are defined for
        “<var>A</var> to <var>B</var>” pairs of systems (eventually completed with domain of validity)
        rather than associated to standalone datums.
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> is a “late binding” implementation,
        while some reminiscences of “early binding” approach still exist in the form of the
        <code>DefaultGeodeticDatum.getBursaWolfParameters()</code> property.
        The later is used only if <abbr>SIS</abbr> fails to apply the late binding approach for given reference systems.

    <h4 id="AffineTransform">Affine transform</h4>
    <p>
      Among the many kinds of operations performed by <abbr>GIS</abbr> softwares on spatial coordinates,
      <cite>affine transforms</cite>  are both relatively simple and very common.
      Affine transforms can represent any combination of scales, shears, flips, rotations and translations,
      which are <em>linear</em> operations.
      Affine transforms can not handle <em>non-linear</em> operations like map projections,
      but the affine transform capabilities nevertheless cover many other cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Axis order changes,           for example from (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>) to (<var>longitude</var>, <var>latitude</var>).</li>
      <li>Axis direction changes,       for example the <var>y</var> axis oriented toward down in images.</li>
      <li>Prime meridian rotations,     for example from <cite>Paris</cite> to <cite>Greenwich</cite> prime meridian.</li>
      <li>Dimensionality changes,       for example from 3-dimensional coordinates to 2-dimensional coordinates by dropping the height.</li>
      <li>Unit conversion,              for example from feet to metres.</li>
      <li>Pixel to geodetic coordinate, for example the conversion represented in the <code>.tfw</code> files associated to some <abbr>TIFF</abbr> images.</li>
      <li>Part of map projections,      for example the <cite>False Easting</cite>, <cite>False Northing</cite> and <cite>Scale factor</cite> parameters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Affine transforms can be concatenated efficiently.
      No matter how many affine transforms are chained, the result can be represented by a single affine transform.
      This property is more easily seen when affine transforms are represented by matrices:
      in order to concatenate those operations, we only need to multiply those matrices.
      The “pixel to geographic coordinate conversions” case below gives an example.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
      <p><b>Example:</b>
        given an image with pixel coordinates represented by (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) tuples
        and given the following assumptions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no shear, no rotation and no flip.</li>
        <li>All pixels have the same width in degrees of longitude.</li>
        <li>All pixels have the same height in degrees of latitude.</li>
        <li>Pixel indices are positive integers starting at (0,0) inclusive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then conversions from pixel coordinates (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>)
        to geographic coordinates (<var>λ</var>,<var>φ</var>) can be represented by the following equations,
        where <var>N</var><sub><var>x</var></sub> is the image width and
        <var>N</var><sub><var>y</var></sub> the image height in number of pixels:
      </p><p>
        <xi:include href="../math/PixelToGeographicTerms.html"/>
      </p><p>
        Above equations can be represented in matrix form as below:
      </p><p>
      <xi:include href="../math/PixelToGeographic.html"/>
      </p><p>
        In this particular case, scale factors <var>S</var> are the pixel size in degrees
        and translation terms <var>T</var> are the geographic coordinate of an image corner
        (not necessarily the lower-left corner if some axes have been flipped).
        This straightforward interpretation holds because of above-cited assumptions, but
        matrix coefficients become more complex if the image has shear or rotation
        or if pixel coordinates do not start at (0,0).
        However it is not necessary to use more complex equations for supporting more generic cases.
        The following example starts with an “initial conversion” matrix
        where the <var>S</var> and <var>T</var> terms are set to the most straightforward values.
        Then the <var>y</var> axis direction is reversed for matching the most common convention in image coordinate systems (change 1),
        and axis are swapped resulting in latitude before longitude (change 2).
        Note that when affine transform concatenations are written as matrix multiplications, operations are ordered from right to left:
        <var>A</var>×<var>B</var>×<var>C</var> is equivalent to first applying operation <var>C</var>,
        then operation <var>B</var> and finally operation <var>A</var>.
      </p>
      <table class="hidden"><tr>
        <th>Change 2</th><th></th>
        <th>Change 1</th><th></th>
        <th>Initial conversion</th><th></th>
        <th>Concatenated operation</th>

      </tr></table>
      <p>
        A key principle is that there is no need to write Java code dedicated to above kinds of axis changes.
        Those operations, and many other, can be handled by matrix algebra.
        This approach makes easier to write generic code and improves performance.
        Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> follows this principle by using affine transforms for every operations
        that can be performed by such transform.
        For instance there is no code dedicated to changing order of ordinate values in a coordinate.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h4 id="AffineTransformAPI">Integration with graphical libraries</h4>
    <p>
      About all graphical libraries support some kind of coordinate operations, usually as <cite>affine transforms</cite>
      or a slight generalization like <cite>perspective transforms</cite>.
      Each library defines its own <abbr>API</abbr>. Some examples are listed below:
    </p>
    <table>
      <caption>Affine transform implementations in graphical libraries</caption>
      <tr><th>Library</th>                                  <th>Transform implementation</th>                          <th>Dimensions</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Java2D</td>                                   <td><code>java.awt.geom.AffineTransform</code></td>        <td>2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Java3D</td>                                   <td><code>javax.media.j3d.Transform3D</code></td>          <td>3</td></tr>

      <tr><td>Java Advanced Imaging (<abbr>JAI</abbr>)</td> <td><code>javax.media.jai.PerspectiveTransform</code></td> <td>2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Android</td>                                  <td><code>android.graphics.Matrix</code></td>              <td>2</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      However in many cases, affine or perspective transforms are the only kind of coordinate operations supported by the graphical library.
      Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> needs to handle a wider range of operations, in which affine transforms are only special cases.
      In particular most map projections and datum shifts can not be represented by affine transforms.
      <abbr>SIS</abbr> also needs to support arbitrary number of dimensions,
      while above-cited <abbr>API</abbr> restrict the use to a fixed number of dimensions.
      For those reasons <abbr>SIS</abbr> can not use directly the above-cited <abbr>API</abbr>.
      Instead, <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses the more abstract <code>org.opengis.referencing.transform.MathTransform</code> interface.
      But in the special case where the transform is actually affine, <abbr>SIS</abbr> may try to use an existing implementation,
      in particular Java2D. The following Java code can be used in situations where the Java2D object is desired:
    </p>
    <pre>MathTransform mt = ...;    // Any math transform created by Apache SIS.
if (mt instanceof AffineTransform) {
    AffineTransform at = (AffineTransform) mt;
    // Use Java2D API from here.
}</pre>
    <p>
      However <abbr>SIS</abbr> uses Java2D on a <em>best effort</em> basis only.
      The above cast is not guaranteed to succeed,
      even when the <code>MathTransform</code> meets the requirements allowing Java2D usage.
