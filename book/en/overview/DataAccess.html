        The <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19115 standard defines hundreds of elements.
        Some of them will be introduced progressively in next chapters.
        But in order to give some idea about what is available, the following table lists a few metadata elements.
        Most of the nodes accept an arbitrary amount of values.
        For example the <code class="OGC">extent</code> node may contain many geographic areas.
      </p>
