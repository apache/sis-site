        It is possible to instantiate data structures programmatically in memory.
        But more often, data are read from files or other kinds of data stores.
        There is different ways to access those data, but an easy way is to use
        the <code class="sis">DataStores.open(Object)</code> convenience method.
        The method argument can be a path to a data file
        (<code>File</code>, <code>Path</code>, <code>URL</code>, <code>URI</code>), a stream
        (<code>Channel</code>, <code>DataInput</code>, <code>InputStream</code>, <code>Reader</code>),
        a connection to a data base (<code>DataSource</code>, <code>Connection</code>)
        or other kinds of object specific to the data source.
        The <code class="sis">DataStores.open(Object)</code> method detects data formats
        and returns a <code>DataStore</code> instance for that format.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>DataStore</code> functionalities depend on the kind of data (coverage, feature set, time series, <i>etc.</i>).
        But in any cases, there is always some metadata that can be obtained.
        Metadata allows to identify the phenomenon or features described by the data
        (temperature, land occupation, <i>etc.</i>),
        the geographic area or temporal period covered by the data, together with their resolution.
        Some rich data source provides also a data quality estimation,
        contact information for the responsible person or organization,
        legal or technical constraints on data usage,
        the history of processing apply on the data,
        expected updates schedule, <i>etc.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Various data formats have their own metadata model, but Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr> translates all of them
        in a unique metadata model in order to hide this heterogeneity.
        This approach — to select a single metadata model as the <em>pivot model</em> — is often used by other libraries.
        For example Apache Tika uses <cite>Dublin Core</cite> as the pivot metadata model,
        while Java Image I/O defines its own standard metadata model in its <code>javax.imageio.metadata</code> package.
        For Apache <abbr>SIS</abbr>, the chosen pivot model is the <cite><abbr>ISO</abbr> 19115-1:2014 — Fundamentals</cite>
        international standard, completed by <cite><abbr>ISO</abbr> 19115-2 — Extensions for imagery and gridded data</cite>.
        This model organizes metadata in a tree structure where each information is accessible by a well-defined path,
        regardless the origin of that information.
        For example if a data format can provides a geographic bounding box encompassing all data,
        then that information will always be accessible (regardless the data format) from the root <code>Metadata</code> object
        under the <code class="OGC">identificationInfo</code> node, <code class="OGC">extent</code> sub-node,
        <code class="OGC">geographicElement</code> sub-node.
      </p>
      <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
          following code read a metadata file from a Landsat-8 image and prints the declared geographic bounding box:
        </p>

<pre><code>try (DataStore ds = DataStores.open(new File("LC81230522014071LGN00_MTL.txt"))) {
    Metadata md = ds.getMetadata();

    // In order to make this example simpler, null values and empty collection checks are omited.
    Identification   idInfo = md    .getIdentificationInfo().iterator().next();
    Extent           extent = idInfo.getExtents()           .iterator().next();
    GeographicExtent bbox   = extent.getGeographicElements().iterator().next();

    System.out.println("The geographic bounding box is:");
    System.out.println(bbox);
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          This example produces the following output (this area is located in Vietnam):
        </p>

<pre><samp>The geographic bounding box is:
Geographic Bounding Box
  ├─West bound longitude…………………………… 108°20′10,464″E
  ├─East bound longitude…………………………… 110°26′39,66″E
  ├─South bound latitude…………………………… 10°29′59,604″N
  └─North bound latitude…………………………… 12°37′25,716″N</samp></pre>

        <p>
          The Java code in this example extracts metadata elements by Java method invocations like <code class="GeoAPI">getExtents()</code>,
          but the next chapters will introduce another way using paths given as character strings.
          That later approach is more convenient when the methods to invoke are not known at compile-time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19115 standard defines hundreds of elements.
        Some of them will be introduced progressively in next chapters.
        But in order to give some idea about what is available, the following table lists a few metadata elements.
        Most of the nodes accept an arbitrary amount of values.
        For example the <code class="OGC">extent</code> node may contain many geographic areas.
