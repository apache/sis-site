# Coordinates of some cities in USA. The coordinates are given
# with only 3 significant digits, which implies an uncertainty
# of more than 100 metres.  With such uncertainty, it does not
# matter if the geodetic datum is WGS84, NAD83 or NAD27  since
# the error is greater than the difference between those datums.
#
# Axis order is latitude first, then longitude. Units are degrees.
